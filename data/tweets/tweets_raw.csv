What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
I find it very sad that we have a President with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful.
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college recordsall of them.
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?

Maybe Derek Jeter should ask ARod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon ARod won't need a place in NYC.
Obama has called Libya attack 'a bump in the road' and 'not optimal.' Just come clean alreadytell Americans the truth!
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success he is a great champion.
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
The biggest problem with ARod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees he must go.

I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
Obama should stop talking about wind turbinesthey are a disaster for a country or community are very expensive unreliable.
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face itthis stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement probably on Wednesday.
"Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose."
We should march on Washington reautismwith leadership common sense the numbers would drop precipitously!
Autism rates through the roofwhy doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctorinflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get electedbe careful Republicans!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick very thrilling.
"Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert."
even though Obama dumped the Reverend like Robert should dump Kristin.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obamajust wait and see!
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
"Well this is it, the final debate let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live."
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy and I mean much more.
"Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view.' Steven Spielberg"
"When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said 'Ok, go get him'?"
"Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden's killing, not the President."
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden now he wants all of the credit!
Last night was the first time Obama said 'we' instead of 'I' in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
"Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert Kristen.I don't have time except to say 'Robert, drop her, she cheated on you will again!"

Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.
All predictions re my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect. Stay tuned!
The response has been fantastic actually overwhelming! Thank you!
"My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record."
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses. All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. Why can't he release his records? Especially when $5M is going to charity.
"By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity."
"In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public"
Just stated by a total pro 'You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking.
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice. Everyone wins. Take the deal.
"michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. he wasn't."
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.
"For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go."
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
"The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants.' The America We Deserve"
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
I will soon start naming magazines that I think will foldI predicted Newsweek.
Be careful of an Obama 'bomb' to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohiomake sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
"If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!"
"If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?"
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
AlertThe president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi. He did nothinghe is no leader.
A lot changed when David Letterman said ' he was probably born in this country' the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers I agree.
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killingsemails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
"So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later."
"All weights are on crane's wrong side very precarious below, move out!"
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
"Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President don't fall for it."
"Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday."
"I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast."
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my 'Ali G' interview
"Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything.' Midas Touch"
"How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?"
"Let's be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday."
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
Scary. Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years?
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitornothing wrongin fact it was terrific. A champion!
"Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star."
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
"In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi."
"There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama's choice, once he releases all of his records."
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama's lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
"President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!"
"President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!"
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to. The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a Presidentgive me a break.

It's 10 AM Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!
You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane and Florida doesn't.
Why is Obama's auto bailout now creating jobs in China? He is ruining American industry.
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to Chinaand will!
President Obama missed the deadline!
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
"If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused."
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications they are just not willing to say!
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy. How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi? And he continues to lie to the public!
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc websites as to their professionalism fairness—many people asking for this.
It was announced this morning that unemployment rosethis can't be good for Obama.
"With long gas lines total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama."
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island Long Island.
People are struggling to get gasoline for their carswe are like a third world country.
"Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding."
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
"Unemployment is now 7.9%. Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad!"
"Obama has destroyed the middle class. In '09, median household income was $55,198. Now it is $50,678. Four more years?"
"Go as far as you can see when you get there, you'll be able to see farther.' J.P. Morgan"
Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012. His promises are worthless!
"Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results. They are praying Obama wins."
"Considering Obama hasn't proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won't have a mandate. Another 4 years of legislative stalemate."
"Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama."
Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
We don't want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.

"Remember when you vote, Obamacare is a disaster!"
"Remember, go votewe need real change this time."
It's extremely cold in NY NJ—not good for flood victims. Where is global warming?
We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming. China is thrilled with us!
"In '08, America voted for Hope Change. Instead, we got incompetency. Now it is time to put a real job creator in office. Vote 4 Mitt!"
mcuban Do you mean the President's birthplace?
The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy. How would the press cover this if a Republican was President.
Benghazi is bigger than Watergate. Don't let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die. Kick him out of office tomorrow.
Go out and vote this will be the most important election of our time!
"Answer to your questions I will be voting at 1030 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street, Manhattan"
"I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight win, lose, or draw, I'll be there!"
Why is Obama playing basketball today? That is why our country is in trouble!
"Despite the upcoming election, the cover of paperthin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincolnsad!"
If you voted for Obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for Romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid.' Thanks Walter D!
Remember Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50Mjust to show simple records. He's hiding lots!
SpencerLJackson Yes!
NGen52 I never went bankrupt.
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.
In the 1950's our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years.
"More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama. Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen"
"Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. If you have any problems, notify the poll workers."
Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY NJ are still decimated by Sandy. Wrong!
"If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately."
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.

Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented troublelike never before.
Our nation is a once great nation divided!
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more yearsstay strong and never give up!
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.
The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew itreasons why to follow.
Another four yearsnot good for the country but we'll have to live with it!

Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection. They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that ARod donated to his campaign. Everything ARod touches turns bad.
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win. They love a weak America that they can rip off.
"With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can. Can get a great deal."
"At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race. GOP needs to do better!"
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection. They have never had it so good. Will own America soon.
Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one they should have used me in Florida and Ohio he would be President.
Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win isn't that ridiculous?
The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen StewartI hope!

It's hard to believe that we are rationing gas in NYC. OPEC is laughing all the way to the bank.
"Price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallonwelcome to the new world."

"I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport, a terrible situation!"
"Wow, I never saw the Petraeus thing coming. A straight laced guy! Very sad for him and his family."

President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Another U.S. loss!
"The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists. It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster."

The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News.
"Entrepreneurs If you cannot handle the tough times, you will never be successful in business. Stay positive stay strong!"
Entrepreneurs Keep your momentum going! It's a big factor in sustaining your success. Keep moving forward!
That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. Solders died looking for him. U.S. should NEVER have made the deal! PUNISHMENT?
"Great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U.S. military deserter. That's how the U.S. negotiates nowadays."
President said we would never leave a soldier behind. How about the 4 who died in Benghazi?

The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. They are saying how dumb U.S. is!
"Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl? Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything, from ObamaCare to a deserter."

The same 'brilliant' negotiators that gave up five Taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with China others.No chance
"REMEMBER, the terrible 5 for 1 trade whereby the Taliban got back leaders (killers) and we got back a NOTHING, WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT U.S.!"

"Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crownHypocrite"
Rick Perry failed at the border. Now he is critical of me. He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.

Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers. Jeb doesn't see can't solve the problems.

..but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media!
"The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our 'leaders' can't say no!"
"El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the U.S."
".likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico through the border. We get the killers, drugs crime, they get the money!"
"When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, 'Mexico is sending.', which turned out to be true? El Chapo"
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security.

"All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything."
I will make this right for our great Vets!
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..

I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.
John McCain called thousands of people 'crazies' when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.

"Great American heroes who averted an attack in France. THANK YOU! Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, Alex Skarlatos."

"Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip. Thank you Iowa!"
"Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info"
"For those that don't think a wall (fence) works, why don't they suggest taking down the fence around the White House? Foolish people!"
President Obama wants to change the name of Mt. McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years. Great insult to Ohio. I will change back!
150 Clinton Emails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP national result) is the best yet. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on 'hit' ads funded by lobbyists special interests. Bad system.
"While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the 'bosses' and 'owners' of candidates. I am self funding."
Congrats everyonewe topped 4 million today on Twitterand heading up fast!
"I'm turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters."
"The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!"
"When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been"
The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!
Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory Tom is my friend and a total winner!
"The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast, before it is too late!"
"Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake alBaghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more typical 'gotcha' questions"
"Wow, the Dallas event in two weeks looks like a big winner! Get your tickets (American Airlines Center) FAST!"
Saudi Arabia was 'vehemently' against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
"Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black"
"Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompterbut there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!"
"Remember that I am selffunding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED"
"By selffunding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!"
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
"The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!"
"Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!"
The Dallas event on September 14 at 600 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
"I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran."
"Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 100 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 600 P.M. American Air Center"
Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
Tomorrow in DC 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.
"Wow! Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President. Thank you, Robert."
I'm self funding my campaign but lobbyists special interests for Jeb others are starting to do big ads—desperate! Don't believe them.
The lobbyists special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me 'just a little' but is very false!
Jeb's policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!
See you in D.C. tomorrow at 100 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!
"I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!"
"Wow, I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me"
Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him.
. I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I've been proven right.
"Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames. Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa."
Let's all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!
Just purchased NBC's half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% stay tuned!

"To all my fans, sorry I couldn't do The Apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!"
My opponents big bosseslobbyists and donorsare trying to do damage. They will fail! Money down the drain!
Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!

"Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 I said 'NO'. Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!"
The polls are really looking good—1 everywhere despite all lobbyist special interest $ being spent against me. I'm turning down millions.
"Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!"
"I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!"
"Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!"
GIVE AMERICA BACK ITS DREAM!
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
"If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!"
"If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!"
"Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great"
On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!
There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!

"We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!"
"Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres."

"Despite the establishment and the media's best efforts, the people are speaking loudly and clearly. Thank you to my amazing supporters!"

At the Old Post Office
Just left Oklahoma the most amazing crowd and people! What a night!
"Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is VERY weak on immigration, knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals!"
"Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed."
Do you believe this Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal!
Prediction Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him he will announce soon. 1%!
I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them.
"Carl Icahn said this about me 'I think at this moment in time, he's the only candidate that speaks out about the country's problems."
"I watched lightweight Senator Marco Rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration. Pathetic!"
Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate. Lazy!
"Interesting, polls on who won the GOP debate."

"Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other, as I knew they would, in order to be the last 'establishment' man standing against me.Great"
"Rubio was very disloyal to Bush, his mentor, when he decided to run against him. Both said they 'love' each other.They don't word is hate!"
"Just leaving Nashville, Tennessee. Had a great time with a fabulous crowd of people! Love Nashville back soon!"
The people of Tennessee yesterday were amazing. Thank you!
"I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!"
"For all of my fantastic supporters, and for the U.S.A., we are going to win and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe greater than ever before!"
The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.
Thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of South Carolina.
"Political strategist Stuart Stevens,who led Romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victory,has terrible political instincts!"
"So, so, so important MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Don't ever forget, we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!"

"Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire, a truly special place!"
"At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!"
Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!
The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA CHINA?
"How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia Iran if he gets caught doing a 'plant' during my speech yesterday in NH?"
"Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)"
"We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight. I will shoot straight and call it as I see it, both the good and the bad. Enjoy!"
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.
"O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance."
"All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage."

Good move by Bernie S.
"Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!"
Sanders said only black lives matter wow! Hillary did not answer question!
"Wow, I am giving a speech on OAN. Much more exciting than debate!"
Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
"Like her or not, Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. Her opponents were very gentle and soft!"
DemDebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers.
The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the 'B' team. She won't be so lucky when it comes to me!
"Will be going to Richmond, Virginia today. Big crowd! See you there."
"Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler's song, he asked me not to. Have better one to take its place!"

On at 900A.M. or 1000 A.M. (depending on your location) on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace. Enjoy!
"Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!"
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)! Have fun.
"Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? Bad info?"
"It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal, in particular a real dope named Charles Lane!"
"It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!"
Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too softwe need tougher sharper
"Both Aberdeen and Turnberry in Scotland, and the soon to open Doonbeg in Ireland, blow Bandon Dunes away. Bandon is a toy by comparison!"

"While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place?"
"This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush. His campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money U.S. GOVT."
"Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do."
"Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S."
"Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!"
"Remember that Carson, Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration. They will do NOTHING to stop it. Our country will be overrun!"
Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare I want to save it and Social Security.
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's is selffunding.
Re Super PAC scam What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace.
All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC's. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself
"I am leaving for Sioux City, Iowa great event (rally)."
"After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa, I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!"
CNBC POLL TOTAL TRUMP 25.22 CARSON 19.78 RUBIO 9.67.
"Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance it was a lot of fun! Today I will be speaking in Reno, Nevada."
Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President. They are a total scam on our system and country! I am selffunding.
"I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn't have a clue weak!"
"Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc."

Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya
"Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!"
No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!
Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time money!
"Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win"
"Jeb's new slogan 'Jeb can fix it'. I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word 'fix' is not a good one to use in politics!"
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
"Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a 'lightweight'."
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
"While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP."
"Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S."
"Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, 'he's my friend!' Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say 'disloyal guy, no friend!"
"The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worsetrying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!"
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
"With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it?"
"Carson now admits his friend named 'Bob,' who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!"
"So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!"
"BillKristol has become a sad case. His magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong!"
Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight. The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic! Enjoy
They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show! Off to a good start!
"I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio electricity all over the place. We will be doing a 'tweeting' skit, so stay tuned!"
Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn't hire to run one of my smaller companies a highly overrated politician!
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat chugging water. He choked!

Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night. Thank you! Timing could not have been better!
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.
"We need much tougher, much smarter leadership and we need it NOW!"
"Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!"
"Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown."
"Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for African American youth 51%."
"I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!"
"When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!"
I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!
"We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!

"Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil."
"Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee! Massive crowd expected! Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter."
So many great polls like Reuters big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitudea man who is resigned to defeat"
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?
Ben Carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants. Not good!
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL!
"Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration the wall. After Paris, they're all on the bandwagon."
The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave not easy!
"Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me."
"John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me."
"John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!"
"I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don't want to waste my money."
Watch Kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
"I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!"
"John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off I said NO! Now ripping Kasich."
Doesn't help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else he's almost last.
"John Kasich fell right into President Obama's trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!"
"Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete total dud!"
"John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!"
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders 'MASTERMINDS.' Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
"The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!"
"Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!"

"To show you how politicians act, Bobby Jindal spent $1,000 to register in New Hampshire dropped out the next day. Such a waste!"
"Heading to Birmingham, Alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people! 12 noon will be wild."
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker a wacko now trying to raise funds to fight me.
"Rumor has it Pataki, Kasich, Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon. Hope it's not true, they're so easy to beat!"
Thank you John Nolte for wonderful analysis reporting.
Great poll numbers all over and beating Hillary Clinton one on one. Thank you!
13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U.S. through the Southern Border. How many made it? WE NEED THE WALL!

Virtually noone has spent more money in helping the American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota
"Sarasota was an unbelievable success. We expected 5,000, a record, but 12,000 showed up! Great love in the air!"
"The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!"
"After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!"
"Wow, the MSM is really going after me. 12,000 in Sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. Only one negativity they only want negatives!"
"How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!"
"The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll 's. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!"
I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!
Look at the editorial I was just sent from the NY Post on 9/14/01 3 days after collapse of WTC. Any apologies?
"Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?"
"You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates."
Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.
California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!
"Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally. Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad!"
Congratulations on the GREAT job done by POLICE and law enforcement on the California shootings. Give credit where credit is due.
"I consider my health, stamina and strength one of my greatest assets.The world has watched me for many years and can so testifygreat genes!"
"As a presidential candidate, I have instructed my longtime doctor to issue, within two weeks, a full medical reportit will show perfection"
"Loved being in Manassas, VA last night. Such incredible spirit! Now in DC for a speech, will then visit Old Post Office under construction."
"Great to see the construction of the Old Post Office on Penn Ave. Going fast under budget, ahead of schedule!"
"The virtually incompetent Republican Strategist who has had a failed career, Cheri Jacobus, is incoherent with anger that her puppets died!"
The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. Why didn't they report?
"Raleigh, North Carolina, was fantastic last night. Such incredible spirit. We all want to, and will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
Hillary just said that she will not use the term 'radical Islamic' but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of Obama the emails!
Watch Face The Nation will be on now!
"So, how did I do on Face The Nation?"
.BrookslawBrooks Thank you so much for your nice words. I will make you look very smart!
I will be livetweeting President Obama's primetime speech tonight starting at 750 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems?

BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 750 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
"I will be retweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff."
Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
"The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good, but the words will be the key."
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
Is that all there is? We need a new President FAST!
"Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL."
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
"Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS."
"Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?"
"I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group, many friends, in D.C. I said 'I'm a negotiator like you' Got standing Orated best of day!"
"N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime! Disgrace"
"I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa. In the end, I believe the final results will be even better than that!"
I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll. Thank you!
Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred danger coming into our country. We must be vigilant!
A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire. Will be very interested in the results.
"Prior to the end of the year, I will be traveling to Israel. I am very much looking forward to it."
"Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism. We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late!"
"Wow, what a day. So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U.S."
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President. We need strong and super smart for our next leader or trouble!
"Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!"
"Our VISA system is broken, like so much else in our country. We better get it fixed really fast. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem. Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad! Be honest."
Respected Morning Consult poll just out. I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin 45 to 40!
"Great evening last night in New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union big territory, great people! Thank you."
Never get good 's from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
"Just got back from Iowa, great people!"
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!
"Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation."
"I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!"
People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!
"Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!"
"Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's."
"Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective no strength, no stamina."
.MelindaDC Don't misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISISas you'll find out after I get elected.
The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!
"See, Sanders backed Hillary on Emails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!"
"President Obama spends so much time speaking of the socalled Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747."
"Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!"
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
Hillary said at debate ISIS is 'going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst.' She made up storywant apology!
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
"Hillary said with respect to ISIS, 'we are finally where we need to be.' Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? MAGA!"
"Just out TRUMP GOP DEBATE 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!"
Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about 'the video' of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.
Getting ready to leave for Michigan will be an amazing evening! See you there.
"HerschelWalker, thanks for your support it is very much appreciated!"
"Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!"
"Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!"
"When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!"
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
"We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!"
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
"Hillary, when you complain about 'a penchant for sexism,' who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!"
Hillary said 'I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign.' I deplore the death and destruction she causedstupidity
"Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly"
"Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!"
"I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!"
"Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!"
"We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!"
"When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say 'we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?' Never!"
"The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary."
"The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it"
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!
"Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!"
"I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to dono strength/stamina!"
"It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!"
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid! RNC
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
"If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!"
"The middleclass has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years. BAD"
"Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!"
"Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!"
"Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double triple them, a disaster!"
"Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!"
"My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C."
"So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million done. Run country my way!"
"The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper."
"Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting"
A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's emails. They just want it all to end. BAD!"
"I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!"
"Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!"
I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.
"The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped!"
"Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!"
"Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!"
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
"When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!"
"Remember, I am selffunding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interestsonly the U.S.A.!"
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
Just returned from Mississippi a great evening.
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
"AlShabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me they all will as frontrunner if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!"
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
"Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch."
"Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!"
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.
"I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expectedwe will have lots of fun!"
"The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
I am in New Hampshire. Just received great news from Reuters poll. Thank you for your support!
Germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!
"Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!"
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
"I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total messbig crime. GET SMART!
Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
"I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!"
We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable!
"Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing."
On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd look forward to it!
"Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic backup, tremendous crowd! Will be wild."
"Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!"
South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies packed houses. Love it!
(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate selffunding!
"Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!"
"Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch"
"If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn't questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can't win."
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
"Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!"
The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!
"On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be greatI love the people of Iowa!"
"The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and nonsubstantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!"
"Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. historyI get most new voters!"
"Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!"
"Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!"
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.
"Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O."
Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.
Just got back from Iowa had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!
"More radical Islam attacks today it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct."
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
Ted Cruz said he 'didn't know' that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
"Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!"
"The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!"
"Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate."
"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a 'natural born Canadian,' did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
"Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!"
"If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?"
"Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!"
"Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite"
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about demeaning?
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.
"In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!"
"Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving thembut they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!"
"Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!"
"I am selffunding my campaign putting up my own money, not controlled. Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses."
"I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd, unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki!"
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
"Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that 'Ted Cruz must be defeated.' Big shoker! People do not like Ted."
"15K in OK! Had to turn away 5k, but we are coming back soon to take care of them! So much love in the crowd! Thanks!"
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
"Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead."
"The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!"
"Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines."
"Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, 'Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President.' Big problem"
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good great new polls!
Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
"Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin."
"Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!"
"Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure never sold off assets."
I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
"I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no actionit won't happen!"
"Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!"
"Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!"
"Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house overflow!"
"Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa."
"It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada, or get out of race"
I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours.
Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll 's are way down!
Cruz going down fast in recent polls dropping like a rock. Lies never work!
Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!
"Great honor Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!"
"I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!"
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh the guy is fantastic!
"Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?"
FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!
"On Greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow what an honor!"
"Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University."
The 'debate' tonight will be a total disaster low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.
"Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $6,000,000 for our great vets. They were so happy proud"
"Getting ready to take off for Nashua, New Hampshire. Big crowd, will be there soon. Fun!"
"They say that if I participated in last night's Fox debate, they would have had 12 million more would have broken the all time record."
"The new email release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?"
Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!
"I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters 'in violation.' They are now under investigation. Bad!
"I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!"
"Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!"
"Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!"
"Wow, just saw an ad Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal replace. He lies!"
"By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing 'unfairness' while raising $6,000,000 for VETS."
"If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000."
It all begins today WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
"Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there a fraction of Cruz Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor"
The media has not covered my longshot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the medialater in New Hampshire. Big crowd
"I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for selffunding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!"
"Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!"
"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"
"Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters."
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
"Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified."
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud!
Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for 'deceit and dirty tricks and lies.
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
"This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum."
"Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire, boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll, very nice!"
Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.
"I very much look forward to tomorrow's debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!"
"10,000 people in South Carolina, unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow love it."
"Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!"
I love New Hampshire will be an exciting evening!
I will be on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd on NBC this morning. Enjoy!
So far the Super Bowl is very boring not nearly as exciting as politics MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!
Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bushspent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!
"Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!"
"I know the 'Governors' and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!"
Noone has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help outand am happy to have done so!
The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
New Hampshire vote today MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"ISIS is making big threats today no respect for U.S.A. or our 'leader' If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results"
We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!
We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.
"Thank you to the people of New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina."
Such a great experience in New Hampshire amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
"So funny, Jeb Bush called me a 'highly gifted politician and a great entertainer' I assume that is a compliment!"
Big speech tonight in South Carolina 700 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

"Just saw the phony ad by Cruz totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies is this man crazy?"
Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
"Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist, Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!"
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goatfired like a dog! Ted panicked.
Ted Cruz does not have the right 'temperment' to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

"Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!"
"Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown."
They don't like Rubio in Florida he left them high dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
Never let them see you sweat!
I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

"I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!"
"Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!"
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
"Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer not true, not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company don't think I ever even used."
"I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita, and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!)."

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??
"The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!"

"It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!"
"Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island great to be home!"
"So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!"
"Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight"
"Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!"
I win a state in votes and then get nonrepresentative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger totally unfair!
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
"Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!"
Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters
Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!
"I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!"
"Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him."
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bossesI am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him K
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
Lyin' Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Thank you New York, I will never forget!"
"Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!"
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
"Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!"
Lynne Ryan just read your great story in the NY Times I am proud of you. Thanks!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
"As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!"
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
"Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!"
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician can't make a deal work.
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
"The CruzKasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!"
"Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!"
How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!
Agreed!
"I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express new and clean, not bad!"
"Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!"
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
"Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort"
"I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 1200 this afternoon. See you there!"
So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put upI won in a landslide!
Heading to rally with Bobby now! See you soon!
"Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal dead on arrival!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!"
We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
The 'protesters' in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
The economy is bad and getting worsealmost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!
"Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while big rally! See you soon!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to 'dealing with men who get off the reservation.' Actually, she has done poorly with such men!"
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First so do voters!
"I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!"
"Will be in South Bend, Indiana in a short while big rally! See you soon!"
"Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure not very presidential. Sad!"
"Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the racestop wasting time money"
"Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special peopleI will never forget!"
What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.
"Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates otherwise. He should show them, run as an Independent."
"Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, 'We are going to put a whole lot of coal minerscoal companies out of business.' She then apologized."
"Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!"
"Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!"
"Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card it is sad!"
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
"Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!"
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Let's properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren's records to see if she is Native American. I say she's a fraud!
"Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton's flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American."
"Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy."
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
"Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action maybe her Native American name?"
"Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!"
I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!
"Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!"
I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
"If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!"
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people!
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
"Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!"
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
"I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!"
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big dayget out and vote!
The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me I can't tell the truth about her husband? Don't feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
"Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!"
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn't have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
"If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!"
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman's card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet 'when a woman stands up to you
"Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn't care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!"
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
"If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we'd have no jobs in America—she doesn't have a clue."
"Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!"
"If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?"
Great new poll thank you!
"The media is really on a witchhunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it but we will prevail!"
"Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run."
"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.' This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!"
"I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!"
"What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no."
"Wow, 30,000 emails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?"
"The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. 'You can tell them to go BLANK themselves' was about China, NOT WOMEN!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
"Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the 'energizer' to D.C.?"
"How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?"
"Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!"
"Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?"
I like Michael Douglas!
Will go back on for a final question now!
"Well, that is it. Well done Megyn and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how 'THE MOVEMENT' does in Oregon tonight!"
"I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, email investigation is rigged so time to get it on!"
"Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you."
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
"Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!"
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is 'not qualified' to be president because she has 'very bad judgement' Bernie said the same thing!
"Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!"
"Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
"While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!"
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!"
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
"How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?"
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can't allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race email scandal!
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
"In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Obama's VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not 'widespread.' I will take care of our vets!
"While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!"
"Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups."
"Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media."
"I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!"
"Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim."
"elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American, is a lowlife!"
"elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
"The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!"
"Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history."
The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
"I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard."
"The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH"
I (we) broke the alltime record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary by a lot and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money get much better results! What we need as Prez!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
"Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrsan embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!"
The Republican Party has to be smart strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
"If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!"
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
"In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!"
"The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!"
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record"
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
"I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!"
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor they do an amazing job.
"Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc."
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
"So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle totally biased."
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of emails. Many missing!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making abilityzilch!
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
"Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?"
"With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes and I mean real monsters! No more HRC."
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions."

"Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!"
"Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!"
"In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!"
"Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile."
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
"Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
"A massive blow to Obama's message only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!"
"I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!"
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews most votes ever recieved
"I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!"
"Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me."
"As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!"
Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!
"Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice."
"The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!"
Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racistbut I am least racist person there is
"Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!"
Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly.
"Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!"
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
"Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart vigilant?"
"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness vigilance. We must be smart!"
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted 'Allah hu Akbar!' as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just brokesaid she would now use!
"I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 230 P.M."
"In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror."
"American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening."
AMERICA FIRST!
Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
"I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns."
"Amazing crowd last night in Dallas more spirit and passion than ever before. Today, all over the great State of Texas!"
People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY! Biggest trade deficit in many years! More attacks will follow Orlando
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
"In Las Vegas, getting ready to speak!"
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!
"When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our presidentreally bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!"
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
"Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy."
"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans and make everyone less safe.
"I am 'the king of debt.'That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S."
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
"If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens."
"Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest."
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been 'disqualifying.
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama.
"SC has kept us safe from exec amnestyfor now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic AfricanAmerican workers."
"Obama Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration."
"On immigration, I'm consulting with our immigration officers our wageearners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street."
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!
"Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!"
"Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!"
"Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave brilliant vote."
"Selfdetermination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see."
"America is proud to stand shouldertoshoulder w/a free ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, as a people w/a shared history."
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT she went with Obama and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
"Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!"
"So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!"
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' but we must enforce the laws of the land!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
"Just landed in New York a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job under budget!"
"George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call."
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
"Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did lie! Was there to support son"
"People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE and JOBS!"

"As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!"

"In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!"
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland will be a great two days!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
I highly recommend the just out book THE FIELD OF FIGHT by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
"The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?"
"Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!"
"Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!"
"Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. Online from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED"
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
"The Wikileaks email release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!"
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
"Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT"
"Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else!"
"Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!"
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders 'political revolution.' He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
"Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new emails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"

"If the Republican Convention had blown up with emails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out"
"Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! Emails say the rigged system is alive well!
"The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!"
"The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!"

"How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb emails, using even religion, against Bernie!"
Hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
"If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released emails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same."
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her 'servant' was doing at the DNC they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie."
"Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and emails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!"

"While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers."
"Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!"
"If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself."
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
"Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!"

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
"As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary top adv."
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition SAD!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to 'carpet bomb' the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complainingthen a small one. Pathetic
"If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!"
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
"Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair."
"A vote for ClintonKaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees."

"Departing now thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT!"

"Little' Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!"
"Crooked Hillary said that I 'couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign.' Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!"
The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
"Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!"

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two 'Big Thursdays' when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches Republican's won ratings
"I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!"
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
"Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 with Bill, VP"
The 'Rust Belt' was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

"The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?"
"Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same Nice!"

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
"CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs."
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's payforplay at State Department?
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary.that's really saying something!

"The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%"
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"
It is not 'freedom of the press' when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
I have always been the same personremain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
"Stay on message' is the chant. I always do trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc but media misrepresents!"

HILLARY'S BAD TAX HABIT!

"Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an 'angel' without checking her past, which is terrible!"
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
"Remember, don't believe 'sources said' by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist."

I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally onesided 'spin' that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.
The socalled Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!

Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night. Very exciting!
"Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee"
Is this really America? Terrible!
"Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!"
"Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty."
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win I will teach them!
"The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!"
"In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!"
I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.
DON'T LET HER FOOL US AGAIN.
Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years why didn't she do them?
Very little pickup by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!
The people of Cuba have struggled too long. Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.
Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the 'incident' in her story. Because it did not happen!
"I am making a major speech in West Palm Beach, Florida at noon. Tune in!"
Just left a great rally in Florida now heading to Ohio for two more. Will be there soon.

"100% fabricated and madeup charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!"
"This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!"
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election
"Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there, and all over the country."
"The MOVEMENT in Portsmouth, New Hampshire w/ 7K supporters. THANK YOU! This is the biggest election of our lifetime get out VOTE on 11/8!"

Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!
"Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!"
"Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!"
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary but also at many polling places SAD
"The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!"
"Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc."
"Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 4743!"
"Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows 'quid pro quo' in Crooked Hillary email probe.Such a dishonest person  Paul Ryan does zilch!"
"Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!"
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
"Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?"
"New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with madeup stories and lies, and got caught"
Get rich quick! Crooked Hillary Clinton's pay to play guide
Great night in WI. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the PEOPLE not the donors!
Plain Simple We should only admit into this country those who share our VALUES and RESPECT our people.
Our country is stagnant. We've lost jobs and business. We don't make things anymore b/c of the bill Hillary's husband signed and she blessed
That was really exciting. Made all of my points. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary.

"The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times."
"Just returned from Pennsylvania where we will be bringing back their jobs. Amazing crowd. Will be going back tomorrow, to Gettysburg!"

If you can't run your own house you certainly can't run the White House' A statement made by Mrs. Obama about Crooked Hillary Clinton

"Legendary basketball coach Bobby Knight who has 900 wins, many championships and a gold medal will be introducing me in Michigan shortly."
Look at the way Crooked Hillary is handling the email case and the total mess she is in. She is unfit to be president. Bad judgement!

"So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!"
"You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We will have MUCH less expensive and MUCH better healthcare. With Hillary, costs will triple!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty cannot run. Rigged system!"
Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all.

"My wife, Melania, will be speaking in Pennsylvania this afternoon. So exciting, big crowds! I will be watching from North Carolina."

The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated demoralized Dems
"The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!"
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
Hillary's debate answer on delay 'That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free
"and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a"
"during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind"
"of position.' Then, separately she stated, 'He said something truly horrifying he refused to say that he would respect the results of"
"this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy.' She then said, 'We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald"
"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally"
It would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4
states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!

"without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies"
"wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but.."
"these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very"
expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS
The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money!
"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.."
their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!

"Whether I choose him or not for 'State' Rex Tillerson, the Chairman CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!"
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
"Unless you catch 'hackers' in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?"

"Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases"
"like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web"

"Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not."
intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed..
"to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story"
is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total 'witch hunt!
It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet.
We must fix our education system for our kids to Make America Great Again. Wonderful day at Saint Andrew in Orlando.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs
"Just out The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone."
Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
"I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!"
How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
"Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show"
Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?
Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again!
"45,000 construction manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. $20 billion investment. We are already winning again, America!"
There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now—we're bringing back the JOBS!
"122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!"
Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster is imploding fast!
I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!
I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.

LinkedIn Workforce Report January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring since August and September 2015
"Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!"
We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!
"It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!"
"ObamaCare is imploding. It is a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far! Republicans will come together and save the day."
Proud to welcome our great Cabinet this afternoon for our first meeting. Unfortunately 4 seats were empty because Senate Dems are delaying!
"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
"Will be going to Detroit, Michigan (love), today for a big meeting on bringing back car production to State U.S. Already happening!"
"Looking forward to a big rally in Nashville, Tennessee, tonight. Big crowd of great people expected. Will be fun!"

"In Nashville, Tennessee! Lets MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Thank you Nashville, Tennessee!"
Great progress on healthcare. Improvements being made Republicans coming together!
My representatives had a great meeting w/ the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce at the WH today. Look forward to tremendous growth future mtgs!
Happy Lá Fheile Phadraig to all of my great Irish friends!
North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!
"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes.."
"vast sums of money to NATO the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"
James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College lost!
"The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!"
Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox
"What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?"
"Thank you Louisville, Kentucky. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!"
Big day for healthcare. Working hard!
Spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May today to offer condolences on the terrorist attack in London. She is strong and doing very well.
Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the socalled Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!
"A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends."
"After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!"
"The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very prolife and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!"
"Today, I was thrilled to announce a commitment of $25 BILLION 20K AMERICAN JOBS over the next 4 years. THANK YOU Charter Communications!"
ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!
"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood Ocare!"
General Kelly is doing a great job at the border. Numbers are way down. Many are not even trying to come in anymore.
"Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech."
The Republican House Freedom Caucus was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. After so many bad years they were ready for a win!
"The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds not long. Do not worry, we are in very good shape!"
Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!
If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!
"The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, fast. We must fight them, Dems, in 2018!"
The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits
and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.
"Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media Dems, of historic proportion!"
"use subsidies to buy health plans.' In other words, Ocare is dead. Good things will happen, however, either with Republicans or Dems."
Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!
"Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck."
The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?
Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate? Just asking!
"Getting ready to meet President alSisi of Egypt. On behalf of the United States, I look forward to a long and wonderful relationship."
It was a great honor to have President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan of China as our guests in the United States. Tremendous
"goodwill and friendship was formed, but only time will tell on trade."
"Congratulations to our great military men and women for representing the United States, and the world, so well in the Syria attack."
The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!
Judge Gorsuch will be sworn in at the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday at 1100 A.M. He will be a great Justice. Very proud of him!
So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns. I have great
confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly.
I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!
"North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A."
"Ron Estes is running TODAY for Congress in the Great State of Kansas. A wonderful guy, I need his help on Healthcare Tax Cuts (Reform)."
Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea.
"Great win in Kansas last night for Ron Estes, easily winning the Congressional race against the Dems, who spent heavily predicted victory!"
Great meeting w/ NATO Sec. Gen. We agreed on the importance of getting countries to pay their fair share focus on the threat of terrorism.
"One by one we are keeping our promises on the border, on energy, on jobs, on regulations. Big changes are happening!"
"Jobs are returning, illegal immigration is plummeting, law, order and justice are being restored. We are truly making America great again!"
"I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A."
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses there will be lasting peace!
It was a great honor to welcome Atlanta's heroic first responders to the White House this afternoon!
Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!
Happy Easter to everyone!
I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republicaneasily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?
Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!
"Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly, we have no choice!"
"The recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event, until the Republicans won. Now they play the same game with GeorgiaBAD!"
A great book for your reading enjoyment 'REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS' by Michael J. Knowles.
The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election. Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth!
"The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!"
"With eleven Republican candidates running in Georgia (on Tuesday) for Congress, a runoff will be a win. Vote 'R' for lower taxes safety!"
The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!
"Democrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress. VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes. Say NO"
Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6. Force runoff and easy win! Dem Ossoff will raise your taxesvery bad on crime 2nd A.
"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG 'R' win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!"
Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.
Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!
"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!"
"China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea so, while nothing is easy, if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will"
"After 5 SB victories since 2002, it was my honor to give Bob Kraft, Coach Belichick, and the players their first tour of the WH Residence."
Getting ready to visit Walter Reed Medical Center with Melania. Looking forward to seeing our bravest and greatest Americans!
Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!
Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.
"Today on Earth Day, we celebrate our beautiful forests, lakes and land. We stand committed to preserving the natural beauty of our nation."
I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter!
Very interesting election currently taking place in France.
ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.
The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.
"Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall."
New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative. Would still beat Hillary in ..
popular vote. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me 53% said strong leader.
"The two fake news polls released yesterday, ABC NBC, while containing some very positive info, were totally wrong in General E. Watch!"
The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If
"If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare is in a death spiral!"
Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!
"Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc."
First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban now it hits again on sanctuary citiesboth ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!
"Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the 'ban' case and now the 'sanctuary' case is brought in"
"the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this 'judge shopping!' Messy system."
The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.
"A great great honor to welcome recognize the National Teacher of the Year, as well as the Teacher of the Year from each State territory!"
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate. I agreed..
"subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are gooddeal very possible!"
The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!
I want to help our miners while the Democrats are blocking their healthcare.
I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border. Democrats want to shut down the government. Politics!
What's more important? Rebuilding our military or bailing out insurance companies? Ask the Democrats.
Democrats used to support border security — now they want illegals to pour through our borders.
As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!
"We are making tremendous progress with the V. A. There has never been so much done so quickly, and we have just started. We love our VETS!"
"North Korea disrespected the wishes of China its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!"
"Looking forward to RALLY in the Great State of Pennsylvania tonight at 730. Big crowd, big energy!"
"Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders great optimism!"
Big excitement last night in the Great State of Pennsylvania! Fantastic crowd and people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"The Democrats, without a leader, have become the party of obstruction.They are only interested in themselves and not in what's best for U.S."
You can't compare anything to ObamaCare because ObamaCare is dead. Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors.New
healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower premiums deductibles while at the same time taking care of preexisting conditions!
"President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!"
The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We.
either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess!
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony
"Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.."
The Fake News media is officially out of control. They will do or say anything in order to get attention never been a time like this!
"I am watching the Democrats trying to defend the 'you can keep you doctor, you can keep your plan premiums will go down' ObamaCare lie."
Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare it is dead. Our healthcare plan will lower premiums deductibles and be great healthcare!
"If victorious, Republicans will be having a big press conference at the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House immediately after vote!"
It was a GREAT day for the United States of America! This is a great plan that is a repeal replace of ObamaCare. Make no mistake about it.
"Big win in the House very exciting! But when everything comes together with the inclusion of Phase 2, we will have truly great healthcare!"
"Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!"
Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.
"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
"Wow,the Fake News media did everything in its power to make the Republican Healthcare victory look as bad as possible.Far better than Ocare!"
Why is it that the Fake News rarely reports Ocare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives? It's dead!
Great jobs report today It is all beginning to work!
"The reason I am staying in Bedminster, N. J., a beautiful community, is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive. Meetings!"
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up it was a lie and it is dead!
Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that's sold in U.S.
General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.
"Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel."
Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today she said nothing but old news!
"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"
"James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI."
"Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"
Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. 'Richie' devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For.
"years, as a pol in Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam except he was never there. When."
"caught, he cried like a baby and begged for forgivenessand now he is judge jury. He should be the one who is investigated for his acts."
Dems have been complaining for months months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!
Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.
The Fake Media is working overtime today!
"As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!."
Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???
James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?"
"China just agreed that the U.S. will be allowed to sell beef, and other major products, into China once again. This is REAL news!"
"As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining."
"to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS terrorism."
"I have been asking Director Comey others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.."
This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
"With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!"
Getting ready for my big foreign trip. Will be strongly protecting American interests that's what I like to do!
We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.
All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace.
Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis. I leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue PEACE in our world.
Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
"Getting ready to engage G7 leaders on many issues including economic growth, terrorism, and security."
"Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should. Money is beginning to pour in NATO will be much stronger."
I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!
.'we push for the removal of all tradedistorting practices.to foster a truly level playing field.
"Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East which will mean JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
Big win in Montana for Republicans!
Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!
"Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names."
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered
British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!
I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead the Republicans will do much better!
"The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!"
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
"North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor, China, by shooting off yet another ballistic missilebut China is trying hard!"
"Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. Thank you, God bless your families God bless the USA!"
I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.
"We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO military. Very bad for U.S. This will change"
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
"The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!"
Who can figure out the true meaning of 'covfefe' ??? Enjoy!
"So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their."
"case against him now wants to clear his name by showing 'the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan' Witch Hunt!"
"Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!"
"Hopefully Republican Senators, good people all, can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal replace) HEALTHCARE bill. Add saved $'s."
I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook even Dems DNC."
"I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 300 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
The big story is the 'unmasking and surveillance' of people that took place during the Obama Administration.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!"
"Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!"
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!"
"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C."
The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court  seek much tougher version!
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!
Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed' statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!
"That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!"
Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard must get it right!
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar look!
"Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH"
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding
"extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!"
Senate passed the VA Accountability Act. The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP! We can't tolerate substandard care for our vets.
"I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow."

"way up. Regulations way down. 600,000 new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.3%. Business and economic enthusiasm way up record levels!"
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!
"Great numbers on the economy. All of our work, including the passage of many bills regulation killing Executive Orders, now kicking in!"
The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!
"Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country. S.C."
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposesgave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???

"Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!"
"They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice"
"Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my nondealings are?"
"Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared they talk about obstruction?"
"After 7 months of investigations committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!"
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media over 100 million people! I can go around them
"Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!"

"By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?"
Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
"Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!"
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
"With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea"

WEEKLY ADDRESS
Just out The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
"Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?"
"Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!"
Obama Administration official said they 'choked' when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
"The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!"
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
"and did not want to 'rock the boat.' He didn't 'choke,' he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good."
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia
"..under a magnifying glass, they have zero 'tapes' of T people colluding. There is no collusion no obstruction. I should be given apology!"
"Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash burn!"

"and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't."

Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
"The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!"
"Heading back to Washington, D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!"
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!
"We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific worked really hard. We will return!"
"As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!"
"With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!"
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!

"Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn't have a clue as.."
the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!
Stock Market just hit another record high! Jobs looking very good.

We are inspired by the stories of everyday heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair through leadership and love.
Very little reporting about the GREAT GDP numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits). Best consecutive Q's in years!
Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News). Thank you Mr. President!
"addresses of any mentioned person who is still living. I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and"

".Also, there is NO COLLUSION!"
"The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was 'no collusion' and events mentioned took place long before he"
".came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!"
I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!
"The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is."
".earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!"
"In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"
"We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"
"My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!"
The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!
"I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!"
"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based."
Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts..

The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures. The safety of our citizens comes first!
"NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!"
Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system
There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!
I am calling on Congress to TERMINATE the diversity visa lottery program that presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security.

Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H.
.This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering where is our Justice Department?
My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting outand having an impact.
Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary the Dems..
"New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted Emails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus"
".People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!"
The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
"Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI Justice Dept."
"ISIS just claimed the Degenerate Animal who killed, and so badly wounded, the wonderful people on the West Side, was 'their soldier.' .."
"Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS 'much harder' over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!"
Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!
"I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right."
"The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!"

"The U.S., under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military, and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, being built right now. I want peace through strength!"
"The North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, commmitment it has made to the U.S. and its allies. It's broken all of those commitments"
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the U.S. should look to our past.and you will doubt it no longer.
"Together, we dream of a Korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again!"

Congratulations to all of the 'DEPLORABLES' and the millions of people who gave us a MASSIVE (304227) Electoral College landslide victory!
In the coming months and years ahead I look forward to building an even STRONGER relationship between the United States and China.
"I don't blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same!"
My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea. He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!

"Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin."
"Why would Kim Jongun insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?' Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend and maybe someday that will happen!"

"After my tour of Asia, all Countries dealing with us on TRADE know that the rules have changed. The United States has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion. The massive TRADE deficits must go down quickly!"

"Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!"
"Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on 'mike' saying bad things about your favorite President. He'll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is 'toast."
"Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (510 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!"
Biggame trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
"Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!"

Marshawn Lynch of the NFL's Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
"Today, we continued a wonderful American Tradition at the White House. Drumstick and Wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains at Gobbler's Rest"
"It wasn't the White House, it wasn't the State Department, it wasn't father LaVar's socalled people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man's version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.."
"LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It's a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!"
The NFL is now thinking about a new idea keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That's almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!..
Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (MaraLago). Stock Market hit new Record High yesterday $5.5 trillion gain since E. Many companies coming back to the U.S. Military building up and getting very strong.

I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn't enough. Can't let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!

New home sales reach a 10 year high. Stock Market has more record gains. Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going! Democrats want big Tax Increases.

"Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that 'if you run, you will win.' She would tell everyone that, 'no doubt, he will win.' I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) and Country is doing great!"

"Dow, SP 500 and Nasdaq all finished the day at new RECORD HIGHS!"
"After North Korea missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our gov't military! Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands."

Great day for Tax Cuts and the Republican Party. But the biggest Winner will be our great Country!

"Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack's past!"
So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!

Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
"The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch."
Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
"The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another alltime Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an alltime high, would be 'low and glum!"

A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!"
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
"62 years ago this week, a brave seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama uttered one word that changed history"
"So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday 'interrogation' with no swearing in and no recording, lies many timesand nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?"
"Many people in our Country are asking what the 'Justice' Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and 'acid washed' 33,000 Emails? No justice!"
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
"After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness."
Report 'ANTITRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE' Now it all starts to make sense!
"Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!"
"Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders so much more. Look at your 401k's since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!"
"With the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market and YOU!"

"I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair 'press,' now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and nonexistent 'sources' are being used more often than ever. Many stories reports a pure fiction!"

"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!"
"Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!"
"Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 400 P.M. Much work to be done, but it will be a great New Year!"

"peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?"
"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the 'Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.' Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D."
"As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do..except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification!"
"With all of the failed 'experts' weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing!"
"Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing."
"Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end chain migration cancel the visa lottery. The current system is unsafe unfair to the great people of our country time for change!"
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!"
"The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is boomingbut the people know! Can you imagine if 'O' was president and had these numbers would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25,000."
"Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new alltime Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!"
"Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!"
The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart!
"Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.."
".Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star.."
".to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius.and a very stable genius at that!"
"Leaving Camp David for the White House. Great meetings with the Cabinet and Military on many very important subjects including Border Security the desperately needed Wall, the ever increasing Drug and Opioid Problem, Infrastructure, Military, Budget, Trade and DACA."
"I've had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President. Now I have to put up with a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I!"
"The Fake News Awards, those going to the most corrupt biased of the Mainstream Media, will be presented to the losers on Wednesday, January 17th, rather than this coming Monday. The interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!"
"The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices, but present and future Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!"
"In every decision we make, we are honoring America's PROUD FARMING LEGACY. Years of crushing taxes, crippling regs, corrupt politics left our communities hurting, our economy stagnant, millions of hardworking Americans COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. But they are not forgotten ANYMORE!"
"We are fighting for our farmers, for our country, and for our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. We want our flag respected and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!"
"As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval."
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
"The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, yet on and on it goes. Russia the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!"
"Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy!"
"Good news Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUV's a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!"
"In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is 'Excellent or Good.' That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll."
"With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!"
"Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS JOBS ACT!"
Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!
"More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant, relocating their heavytruck production from Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to U.S. employees!"
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first!
"The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery Chain. USA!"
"Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for 'peanuts,' only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbonNO!"
"The socalled bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.."
".countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund."
".Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten 'shutdown,' but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for DACA!"
"Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!"
"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.' Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings unfortunately, no trust!"
"Today, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy."
"Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!"
The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!
AMERICA FIRST!
"I don't believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!"
"So much Fake News is being reported. They don't even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!"
"The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them 'I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un' (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn't say that. I said 'I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters"
and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
"DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military."
"Statement by me last night in Florida 'Honestly, I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA, but they don't want to help..We are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to. They don't want security at the border, they don't want.."
"to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.' My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can't get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.
"We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!"
"The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery."
"Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!"
New report from DOJ DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorismrelated charges are foreignborn. We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms.
"Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!"
"ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! Together there is nothing we can't overcomeeven a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!"
"The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.."
".The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is 'peanuts' compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!"
"Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!"
"We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!"
"CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!"
A government shutdown will be devastating to our militarysomething the Dems care very little about!
"Departing Pittsburgh now, where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers, and to show the world that AMERICA is back and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before!"
House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country our Military needs it!
Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!
Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!
"Not looking good for our great Military or Safety Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy."
"For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military Veterans!"
AMERICA FIRST!
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can't let that happen!
"Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!"
"Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, ISIS, Judicial Strength Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate and so much more. Big 2018!"
"Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.'s!"
The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for noncitizens. Not good!
Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don't want to do it but are powerless!
"Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!"
"In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers StrzokPage texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!"
"Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying.with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!"
"Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!"
"Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!"
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!"
"Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!"
"Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get betterOur country is finally WINNING again!"
DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin' Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!
"Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win!"
"I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it!"
Democrats are not interested in Border Safety Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!
"Somebody please inform JayZ that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!"
"Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!"
"Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in '18."
"March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!"
"The Democrats just aren't calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they'll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast."
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank File are great people!
"Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!"
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath.The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier.the FBI became.
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they've done!
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and nonpersonal medical care. No thanks!
"Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!"
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!
"Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!"
"Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!"
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan!"
"In the 'old days,' when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!"
NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!
Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics! What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration!
The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!
"Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!"
"I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 145pm. Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East."
Wow! Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a 'paper trail' on a 'private' meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.
"Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
"Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!"
"Costs on nonmilitary lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!"
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
"The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to redo and send back in proper form!"
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
"Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 20082011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!"
"My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans."
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut Jobs Bill.and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.
"Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong smart, loves Pennsylvania loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!"
"This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!"
"Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?"
"Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn't it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th."
"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school."
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.
"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!"
"While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!"
"lottery, continues deadly catchandrelease, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill!"
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.
"Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida. Will never forget them, or the evening!"
Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference 'There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
"Funny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!"
"Just like they don't want to solve the DACA problem, why didn't the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!"
"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!"
"Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!"
"Finally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!"
"Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn't I a great candidate?"
"If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!"
"Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!"
"My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!"
"Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!"
"Have a great, but very reflective, President's Day!"
"Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?"
"The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS"
".The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to 'rock the boat.' When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems."
"Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R's want to fix!"
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You've come a long way Matt!
"Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new 'pushed' Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste money!"
"I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!"
"Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!"
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.
"Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!"
.immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A 'gun free' school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
".History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!"
".If a potential 'sicko shooter' knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won't go thereproblem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won't work!"
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue I hope!
"Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 1130 A.M. to discuss School Safety. Next week it will be with our Nation's Governors. It's been many years of all talk, no action. We'll get it done!"
"MS13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water. El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!"
CPAC Today!
"My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country."
"For those of you who are still interested, the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them!"
Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again a big very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!
"Dems are no longer talking DACA! 'Out of sight, out of mind,' they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn't care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!"
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!
Dem Memo FBI did not disclose who the clients were the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!
"We've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don't see it.' Judge Ken Starr"
WITCH HUNT!
"I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th."
I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS13 thugs being hit hard.
"Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!"
"Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God's grace."
"Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival. From a large tent in Los Angeles, to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium, to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957"
"Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored. We say a prayer for our country that all across this land, the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God."
"Many ideas, some good some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!"
"Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!"
Jobless claims at a 49 year low!
Manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades!
Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!
"When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymorewe win big. It's easy!"
"Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!"
"We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!"
"When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficithave no choice!"
REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM!
The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!
"If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!"
"The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!"
"We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must.."
treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.
"It's March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months, they just don't care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!"
"The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!"
Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!
"Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don't have Stars anymore except your President (just kidding, of course)!"
"Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"
Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job will choose wisely!
"China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States. Our relationship with China has been a very good one, and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with. We must act soon!"
The U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft. We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!
Looking forward to 330 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.
"Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!"
"The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined."
We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans.
"Congratulations to Kristian Saucier, a man who has served proudly in the Navy, on your newly found Freedom. Now you can go out and have the life you deserve!"
Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
"Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea. Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the U.S. Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit. Not fair or sustainable. It will all work out!"
"Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress. Big happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). Rick will help me a lot. Also, tough on crime border. Loves 2nd A VETS"
"North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!"
"In the first hours after hearing that North Korea's leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled amazed.They couldn't believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what, who cares!"
"The European Union, wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on Steel Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers tariffs on U.S. products going in, we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not, we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!"
"The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.."
"have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access."
"The Republicans are 50 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday."
"The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our governmentA record in U.S. history. State Department, Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW!"
"Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are 'somewhat low.' They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show FAKE NEWS!"
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.
"Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!."
".On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly)."
"If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!"
"The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems.Will raise taxes, weak on Crime and Border."
"THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG INDEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION."
"The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!"
"Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!"
Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California!
"California's sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!"
"It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U.S. Military, straight from the heart of the American People We support you, we thank you, we love you and we will always have your back!"
"All across this nation, we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines! Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America!"
"Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history!"
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!
Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!
"Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began. Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back and that is exactly what is happening!
"We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they dothey almost all doand that's how I know!"
Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU so tragic. Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives. Thank you for your courage. Praying this evening for all who are affected.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the IraqSyria border yesterday. Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.
"It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!"
"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!"
"The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!"
"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!"
"Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?"
"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!"
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!
AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!
"there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!' So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz."
"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing."
"..They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the 'smarts.' Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!"
"Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next yearmost ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment."
"Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall."
"Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!"
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.
"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded."
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 100 P.M.
"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."
"France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack. So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism. Even stronger measures needed, especially at borders!"
"Because of the $700 $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!"
"Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!"
"Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia casedon't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new"
".lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!"
The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
"So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!"
"Trade talks going on with numerous countries that, for many years, have not treated the United States fairly. In the end, all will be happy!"
"THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!"
"For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!"
"Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!"
My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California's Sanctuary laws.
.release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State. All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders.
Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!
"I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs."
".In the interim, Hon. Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!"
"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!"
"We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio. A tremendous honor to be here today at a stateoftheart training site, where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!"
"Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. No more! It's time to REBUILD, and we will do it with American WORKERS, American GRIT, and American PRIDE!"
"While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that 'the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned,' and that"
"does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a 'lobbyist' and should so REGISTER. If the P.O. 'increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.' This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!"
HAPPY EASTER!
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch Release. Getting more dangerous. 'Caravans' coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
"Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!"
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!
"Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large 'Caravans' of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.."
"Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!"
"DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!"
"Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!"
"So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke."
"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field!"
"So sad that the Department of 'Justice' and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!"
"As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS"
"Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!"
"39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!"
"The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The 'Fakers' at CNN, NBC, ABC CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!"
"The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!"
"Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin' Obama at the same time in his Administration."
I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!
WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!
"Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube's HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene."
"Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way they want people to pour into our country unchecked.CRIME! We will be taking strong action today."
"We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!"
"When you're already $500 Billion DOWN, you can't lose!"
"Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS, America is open for business, and millions of American workers are seeing more takehome pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses!"
"Despite the Aluminum Tariffs, Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised, I'm not! Lots of money coming into U.S. coffers and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!"
"China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S."
"Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!"
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
"The United States hasn't had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years. They must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs. The U.S. is losing $500 Billion a year, and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades. Cannot continue!"
We are sealing up our Southern Border. The people of our great country want Safety and Security. The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
"Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking what is going on? BAD!"
"What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good!"
"While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!"
"The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don't exist. Story on John Kelly isn't true, just another hit job!"
"President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do. Taxes will become Reciprocal a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries!"
"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price"
.to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!
"If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!"
"Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win! When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead. Now he is the Masters Champion!"
"When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE going on for years!"
The Democrats are not doing what's right for our country. I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!
Attorneyclient privilege is dead!
A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!
"Last night, it was my great honor to host America's senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America's military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform!"
"Very thankful for President Xi of China's kind words on tariffs and automobile barriersalso, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!"
"The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraineanother negative to the Fake Russia C story!"
"So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton Larry K on board. I (we) are"
".doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!"
"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"
"Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?"
"Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!"
"Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking reelection, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!"
"If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!"
"California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry, good move for the safety of our Country!"
"Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our 'Thank you America?"
Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today. He will be a great Secretary of State!
"I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process."
"Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama. We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!"
"Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!"
"James Comey is a proven LEAKER LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he diduntil he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.."
".untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst 'botch jobs' of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!"
"We are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words MADE IN THE USA!"
"DOJ just issued the McCabe report which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!"
A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!
"So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won't be anything, or anyone, even close!"
"Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!"
"The big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 more?"
"Comey throws AG Lynch 'under the bus!' Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!"
"The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term 'Mission Accomplished.' I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!"
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His 'memos' are self serving and FAKE!
"Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!"
"Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!"
"Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it's hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things."
"Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!"
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!
"Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!"
I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!
"So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking, really nice to see!"
"Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman!"
"Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post, and they haven't changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!"
Welcome Prime Minister Abe!
"Today's Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by."
.Congress House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. Keep America Safe!
States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
"Pastor Andrew Brunson, a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States, is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy, but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!"
"While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don't like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S."
"There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security Safety NOW!"
"Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!"
"Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!"
Great working luncheon with U.S. and Japanese Delegations this afternoon!
"Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who has just left Florida. Talked in depth about North Korea, Military and Trade. Good things will happen!"
"Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk."
"Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy 'up to 400 National Guard Troops' to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown's charade. We need border security and action, not words!"
"Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People. They are 'slow walking' all of my nominations hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!"
"Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!"
Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
"Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult!"
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe 'under the bus.' Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
"James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?"
So General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!
"So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis, Maryland. Looking forward to being there."
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicansgot not one Democrat Vote! Here's a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
"Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"
"Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!"
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World big progress! Look forward to our Summit.
"Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails."
"James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?"
A message from Kim Jong Un 'North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.' Also will 'Shut down a nuclear test site in the country's Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.' Progress being made for all!
"The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will 'flip.' They use."
".nonexistent 'sources' and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if."
".it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!"
"Fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in Key West, Florida. Thank you!"
Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush. First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects. Will be a beautiful day!
"So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!"
"Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!"
"James Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch others?"
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as 'Mr. Magoo' and Rod Rosenstein as 'Mr. Peepers.' This is 'according to people with whom the president has spoken.' There are no such people and don't know these charactersjust more Fake Disgusting News to create ill will!
At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.' Wall Street Journal
"Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven't given up anything they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, no more testing!"
".We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won't only time will tell.But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago!"
A complete Witch Hunt!
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn't come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
"Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, 'you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there.' Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!"
Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. They keep us safe and are very cool about it!
"Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans!"
"Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL"
"Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast."
"Here's a great stat since January 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work!"
"Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny. We are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of God in every human soul."
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent.
Busy day planned. Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be donehe will be GREAT!
"Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple. We will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade."
The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don't support us (including at the United Nations)?
Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can't define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn't understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He's either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!
"After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!"
"KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!"
"Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!"
"Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black Hispanic unemployment in history)."
"Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today. So much to discuss, so little time! It will be good for both of our great countries!"
Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The..
".great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!"
"Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations."
"Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight, will be live on T.V."
"Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester's statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!"
"Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan. The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn't get in, I cherish you.and will be back!"
"Just got recent Poll much higher than President O at same time.Well, much more has been accomplished!"
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy 'comedian' totally bombed (couldn't even deliver her linesmuch like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over!"
"Headline 'Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade' from the Failing New York Times. Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May."
The White House Correspondents' Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!
"Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!"
The migrant 'caravan' that is openly defying our border shows how weak ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.
"During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hardworking entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!"
"The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist). They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can't believe they are saying. Truly bad people!"
"The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going 'bonkers!"
"So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were 'leaked' to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I seeyou have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!"
"Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now. Same with other countries and NAFTAbut it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!"
It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!
"There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!"
"The questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employeewhat the President was thinking is an outrageous..as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone' Joe Digenova, former US Attorney"
A Rigged System They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal 'justice?' At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
"I have been briefed on the U.S. C130 'Hercules' cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard."
"This isn't some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.' John Dowd, March 2018. With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian 'Collusion."
"As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!"

Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!
"Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a nondisclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are.."
"very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,"
"despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction."
"This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis. We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS. Choice is vital, but the program needs work is running out of $. Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve. I will sign immediately!"
"Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!"
"Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!"
"NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite 'sources' which are constantly wrong. Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don't exist, they are fabricated, fiction! NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!"
Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!
"JUST OUT 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime, WITCH HUNT!"
"All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away. We believe in the rule of law and we support the men and women of law enforcement. We have pride in our history"
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm lawabiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!
We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!
"Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!"
"To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can't win the General Election in your StateNo way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!"
"My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!"
"The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it's called Fighting Back"
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injusticeand just wait 'till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!
The Great Revolt' by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men Women are forgotten no longer!
"Good luck to Ric Grenell, our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy, he will represent our Country well!"
"Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!"
"Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the MidTerm Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!"
The United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!
I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 200pm.
"Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America's bright and glorious future!"
"I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 830. The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building."
"John Kerry can't get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country!"
"The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know what will happen. In just a short time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons."
"The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldn't we win?"
"The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?"
"Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart 'thinkers,' and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going onso good for our Country!"
"Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs. His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job!"
"I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date Place set."
Secretary Pompeo and his 'guests' will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 200 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!
"The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News, so bad!"
Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 200 A.M.
Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA!
"On behalf of the American people, WELCOME HOME!"
"Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal but he doesn't really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!"
Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!
The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!

Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all!

Iran's Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reachedjust another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!
"The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!"
Happy Mother's Day!!!
"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"
"China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!"
"Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now, that will not happen!"
"So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes see what is really going on. This kind of sickness hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made."
Big day for Israel. Congratulations!
"ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi."
"The socalled leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!"

"Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it!"
Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace. We stand with our police (HEROES) 100%!
"Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well like they haven't been represented in many years. Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China. Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China
"We have not seen China's demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. China has seen our demands. There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings"
"haven't even started yet! The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!"
"House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act. Who will stand with our Great Vets, caregivers, and Veterans Service Organizations? Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day!"
"Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a donothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare"
"Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American Historyand there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!"
"Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI 'SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.' Andrew McCarthy says, 'There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.' If so, this is bigger than Watergate!"
"Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and 'Haters,' but that's the way it is!"
Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!

It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center. There is nobody like them!
"Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, 'Animals.' Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as 'Animals,' a big difference and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!"
"Why isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!"
"Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story. If true all time biggest political scandal!"
School shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all!
"We grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas. To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever"

Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
"If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!"
".At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption"
"in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam."
"Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the MidTerm Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!"
"What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?"
".and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?"
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia so now they're looking at the rest of the World. Oh' great!
"I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn't President Obama the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen!"
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
"On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time."
"China must continue to be strong tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!"
"John Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the."

"If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal"
"Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!"
"Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!"
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
"Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion."
"Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK."

WITCH HUNT!
"Today on Long Island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS13. I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union"
"Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as CatchandRelease. Democrats must abandon their resistance"
"Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York. Keep up the great work!"
"Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE a terrible thing!"
"Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un."
"It was my great honor to host a roundtable re MS13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York. Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives!"
"I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th. While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world"
"The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an 'Informant' who is paid a fortune and who 'sets up' way earlier than the Russian Hoax?"
"Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!"
"Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a SpyWidespread Spying involving multiple people.' Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!"
"Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!"
"Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!"
"Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won't let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop!"
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don't even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under 'O
"Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing."
but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their socalled Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!
"We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date."
"Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 700 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!"

"Thanks to very brave Teacher Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!"
"With Spies, or 'Informants' as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or 'Justice' contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?"
"When will the 13 Angry Democrats ( those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI Russia?"
WELCOME HOME JOSH!
"Who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationThey went back home in tatters!"
"Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller."
"Why didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation!"
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!
"Why didn't President Obama do something about the socalled Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing."

"California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems along with so many others. On June 5th., vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man. He'll Make California Great Again!"
"Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of countryBipartisan Bill!"
"We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!"

"Why aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!"
"Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc."
"The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men women WON, I'm President!"
"Rep.Trey Gowdy, 'I don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's."
".chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, 'oh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated tooand that's how I read that Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you.."
".There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!' And I wish I did!"
"The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.' JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney."
"Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!"
"The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?"
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
Very good meetings with North Korea.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
FAIR TRADE!
"A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!"
"Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that's O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!"
Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 830 this morning.
Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade! They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! They report a really high surplus on trade with us. Do Timber Lumber in U.S.?
"Today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard!"
There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?
"The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!"
"Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into U.S. coffers?"
"When you're almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you can't lose a Trade War! The U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart!"
"As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of 'Justice' have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!"
".Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired!"
Mark Penn 'Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offensesConstitution was set up to prevent thisStormtrooper tactics almost.' A disgrace!
"This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax Regulation Cuts, Military Vets, Lower Crime Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy Jobs EVER, and much more"
".We had Repeal Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. Drug prices coming down Right to Try!"
This is the best time EVER to look for a job.' James Freeman of WSJ.
"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats ( others) continues into the midterms!"
China already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products. Not acceptable!
The U.S. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN!
"Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks, that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer!"
"The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!"
The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.
In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!
Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out!
"The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!"
"What is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!"
The U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election. May be the best economy in the history of our country. Record Jobs numbers. Nice!
"We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!"
"We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem more great music today at 300 P.M."
"The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himselfI would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruinedand Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!"
Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something bigwe will soon see!
Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats. Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can't get their act together! Started the Wall.
"In High Tax, High Crime California, be sure to get out and vote for Republican John Cox for Governor. He will make a BIG difference!"
"Get the vote out in California today for Rep. Kevin McCarthy and all of the great GOP candidates for Congress. Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi."
"Vote for Congressman Devin Nunes, a true American Patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world.he truly loves our country and deserves everyone's support!"
"Terrific new book out by the wonderful Harris Faulkner, '9 Rules of Engagement.' Harris shares lessons from a military family. Enjoy!"
"The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we've proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in Wasteful Spending! We are getting our government back on track."
"Imagine how much wasteful spending we'd save if we didn't have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years, Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? No more."
"Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch. 'They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system"
"This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff"
.The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!
"Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate's August Recess. Great, maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!"
"The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!"
"Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. Fake News is really bad!"
"Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just don't get what is going on out there or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember, Dems are High Tax, High Crime, easy to beat!"
Congratulations to Dana Rohrabacher on his big California win. We are proud of you Dana!
"Isn't it Ironic? Getting ready to go to the G7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea the Nuclear ProblemBut back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt!"
Good luck to Alice Johnson. Have a wonderful life!
"Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor 'It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel.All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multimillion dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate.' So true!"
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?
"How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn't have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? Let's face it, he's a Flake!"
Our Justice Department must not let Awan Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a 'plea deal' to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!
"When will people start saying, 'thank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?"
The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this 'matter' (as Comey would call it). Investigate!
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the U.S. and Japan, something we have to do. The U.S. seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. We're working hard to reduce our trade imbalance"
"Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create nonmonetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow."
"Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other thingsbut he doesn't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!"
"Why isn't the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and nonmonetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers, workers companies. Take down your tariffs barriers or we will more than match you!"
"Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we don't need his advice!"
"Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn't tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!"
"Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G7 countries. If it doesn't happen, we come out even better!"
"Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular a true Superstar! D.C. is popping, in many ways. What a time!"
I am heading for Canada and the G7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization. Won't be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while!
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia. They are truly all HEROES.
"Henry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning. He is strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets. He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy. Vote on Tuesday!"
"U.S.A. Trade. They fully understand where I am coming from. After many decades, fair and reciprocal Trade will happen!"
"The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough."
I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jongun will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before
Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this onetime opportunity will not be wasted!
"Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!"
"Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!"
"Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit"
.And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATOprotecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the costand laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplusshould pay much more for Military!
".Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!"
"Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air!"
"Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!"
Thank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong!
"Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly.but in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!"
"Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election, with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with Black Hispanic unemployment lowest in History, and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever!"
"The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters losers. We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!"
Just won big Supreme Court decision on Voting! Great News!
"Our Great Larry Kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack. He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center."
"I strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada. Adam is smart, works hard, and knows how to win. He will be a great Governor. Also, will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime!"
"Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!"
"Heading back home from Singapore after a truly amazing visit. Great progress was made on the denuclearization of North Korea. Hostages are back home, will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families, no missiles shot, no research happening, sites closing"
There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce engagement w/ the world. Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security prosperity for his citizens!
I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea proves that real change is possible!
"The World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe! No more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research! The hostages are back home with their families. Thank you to Chairman Kim, our day together was historic!"
"A year ago the pundits talking heads, people that couldn't do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace 'please meet, don't go to war.' Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, 'you shouldn't meet, do not meet!"
"My political representatives didn't want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate, and Sanford was so bad, I had to give it a shot. Congrats to Katie Arrington!"
"Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be 'punchdrunk.' I guess he doesn't"
"realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!"
"Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff, Tim Kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Don't underestimate Corey, a major chance of winning!"
"Just landed a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!"
Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer sleep well tonight!
"We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith which both sides are!"
"The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup. Congratulations a great deal of hard work!"
"Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!"
"So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have 'begged' for this deallooked like war would break out. Our Country's biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!"
"Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV's are not for her. People are really upset, so phony! Josh Hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement."
Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada. Danny worked hard an got a great result. Looking good in November!
The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers. People are starting to see what is being done. Results are speaking loudly. North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!
"Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime."
"So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!"
"The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. I won't settle this case!"
".Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle."
"The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!"
"Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A., Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this, along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail, and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice."
"U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!"
Why in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)?' asks Mark Levin!
"The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!"
"Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!"
"I've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Reportand never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!"
"I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for!"
"Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!"
"My supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. As we get stronger, so does our country. Best numbers ever!"
"The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!"
"Chuck Schumer said 'the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat.' Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home much more!"
"Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I 'met.' That's because that's all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world, more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!"
"Holding back the 'war games' during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!"
"Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well, and moving back to America, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years."
"WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!"
"Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it truth doesn't matter to them!"
The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security Safety. Don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
"The highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.' Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn't it?"
"Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS13, coming into our country illegally?"
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!
"Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border. It is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. Not going to happen in the U.S."
CHANGE THE LAWS!
It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime. Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration. Change the laws!
"If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have, the Fake News would have named him a national hero!"
Comey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey's best friend. Witch Hunt!
I can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!' Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p
Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!
"If you don't have Borders, you don't have a Country!"
"Democrats are the problem. They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS13. They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!"
"We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions."
"CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security."
"I want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Borderit has been going on for many, many decades"
"The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them to obstructwant open borders which means crime!"
"It's the Democrats fault, they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something it never ends!"
Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol. They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford. I have never been a fan of his!
"Don't worry, the Republicans, and your President, will fix it!"
"So sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena I LOVE YOU ALL!"
ALLTIME RECORD OPTIMISM!
"We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password."
"The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi, who are weak on Crime and Border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security now he'll take Crime!"
"I will be going the Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster. Henry worked so hard was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating!"
Last night in Minnesota was incredible. What a crowd!
"What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate, and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the MidTerms). Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Ruleit is killing you!"
"Democrats want open Borders, where anyone can come into our Country, and stay. This is Nancy Pelosi's dream. It won't happen!"
My Administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border. Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democratsand that's what they are they're extremist open border Democrats.
I was thrilled to be back in Minnesota for a roundtable with hardworking American Patriots. Thank you!
Farm Bill just passed in the House. So happy to see work requirements included. Big win for the farmers!
Big Supreme Court win on internet sales tax about time! Big victory for fairness and for our country. Great victory for consumers and retailers.
"I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?' written on the back of Melania's jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!"
"We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country."
"You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including 'heart,' without getting Dem votes. Problem is, they don't care about security and R's do. Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill. They won't vote for anything!"
"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill  the Dems are Obstructionists who won't give votes for political reasons because they don't care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R's!"
"Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!"
"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!"
Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina. He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!
Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda. She is in a Republican Primary runoff against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat. I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District!
"80% of Mexico's Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us, which is fine with me. They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!"
"We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!"
Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!
"Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all."
"Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!"
The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!
The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95.1% of Manufacturers 'have a positive outlook for their companies.' This is the best number in the Association's history!
Disability applications plunge as economy strengthens' Failing New York Times
"Drudge Report 'OBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES, WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL' We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story."
"Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country's economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well."
"It's very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!"
"Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a friend and great man!"
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
"Democrats, fix the laws. Don't RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"
"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents"
".Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!"
"The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!"
"House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don't care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!"
"The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!"
"I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ FBI aren't giving over requested documents?"
"Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!"
"Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country"
".If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!"
"Will be heading to one of my favorite places, South Carolina, to fight for one of my original 'fighters,' Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 700 P.M."
"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!"
"Why is Senator Mark Warner (DVA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn't this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?"
"The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency!"
"Early this year HarleyDavidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced unfair trade is, but we will fix it.."
".We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"
".When I had HarleyDavidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!"
.We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out and it won't take very long!
"It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!"
"A HarleyDavidson should never be built in another countrynever! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!"
"The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future.and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres."
SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!
"Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York, and my many friends on Staten Island, have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!"
"The Democrats are in Turmoil! Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!"
Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.
"Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I'm not going anywhere!"
"HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON'T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS CRIME. WIN!"
"Supreme Court rules in favor of nonunion workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!"
"HarleyDavidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I've done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!"
"Today, I was thrilled to join student leaders from Colleges and Universities across the country"
In recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous law enforcement officers. Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE. Leftwing Activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs and publicly posting their
home addresses putting these selfless public servants in harm's way. These radical protesters want ANARCHY but the only response they will find from our government is LAW AND ORDER!
"Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!"
"Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!"
"Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!"
"When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 ReportAnd what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and"
".persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)And what is going on in the FBI DOJ with Crooked Hillary, the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!"
"I am in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for meetings. Soon to leave for a big groundbreaking for Foxconn, which is building a great new electronics plant in Wisconsin. 15,000 Jobs, so great!"
"Today, we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers! As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States!"
"Prior to departing Wisconsin, I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene."
"Before going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. This attack shocked the conscience of our Nation, and filled our hearts with grief"
"The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS13 clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!"
"To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!"
"Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the differencePrices to high! He has agreed!"
"I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday, July 9th!"
"A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, 'The Briefing Politics, the Press and the President.' It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!"
"I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov."
"Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule or better yet, do both. Cryin' Chuck would do it on day one, but we'll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits be smart!"
"When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!"
"The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again"
"A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!"
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!
"Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their 'leadership' wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party!"
"Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats!"
I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!
"The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that's prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event, they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!"
"When we have an 'infestation' of MS13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov."
"How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!"
"Many good conversations with North Koreait is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!"
"Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?"
"Now that HarleyDavidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!"
Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!
"The Washington Post is constantly quoting 'anonymous sources' that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!"
"After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!"
"Tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible our brave service members, and our wonderful Veterans. For 242 years, American Independence"
"has endured because of the sweat, blood and sacrifice of the American Armed Forces the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world!"
"Tomorrow, families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July. As we do, we will think of the men women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting America  we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES!"
Happy Fourth of July.Our Country is doing GREAT!
"The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!"
"Happy Birthday, America!"
"Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now. Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our.."
"..Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. Tell the people 'OUT,' and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. Hiring thousands of 'judges' does not work and is not acceptable only Country in the World that does this!"
Congress FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!
"I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will"
on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!
"A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos Republicans want LAW, ORDER and JUSTICE!"
"Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!"
"Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, America is WINNING AGAIN and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world. Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST!"
"Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don't exist They will both be out of business in 7 years!"
Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court!
"Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the 'Special' Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation that the only Collusion was with the Dems!"
"The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta so much more. It's a Democrat Con Job!"
The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people!
"They just didn't get it, but they do now!"
"The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits."
"Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!"
I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice Will be announced tonight at 900 P.M.
"I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed , even more importantly, our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese TradeHope Not!"
The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we don't believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.
"Pfizer others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe elsewhere. We will respond!"
Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs ( Barriers)!
"NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!"
"On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment all freed, great job!"
"I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace!"
"Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?"
"The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it. Just doesn't work!"
"Bilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels, Belgium"
"I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open"
"things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!"
Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!
"What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe's protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025."
"If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks, don't Obstruct and Resist, but rather do it the good ol' fashioned way, WIN ELECTIONS!"
"ExFBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!"
"How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!"
"Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn't nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe's borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!"
"Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!"
".On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!"
A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made!
Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!
"Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime, the Border, Illegal Immigration, the 2nd Amendment, our great Military Vets, Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!"
"The Stock Market hit 25,000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!"
".Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?"
"So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn't! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News"
".Remember, it was Little Jeff Z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said I could not win the election in that 'there was no way to 270' (over over again) in the Electoral College. I got 306! They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. Still hurting!"
"There hasn't been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn't the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!"
"Heading to Helsinki, Finland looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia"
"over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition! Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems"
"know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country but at some point, it will heal!"
"Congratulations to France, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally, congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament one of the best ever!"
"Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong rich!"
"President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!"
"Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"
"Thank you Helsinki, Finland!"
"I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!"
"While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way the Fake News is going Crazy!"
The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!
"The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!"
"The Democrats want to abolish ICE, which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November."
So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!
"While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting.."
".Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!"
"Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress. My endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the 'flood gates' opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy!"
"3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition!"
"Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement."
The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS13!
"Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs."
"The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE!"
"The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I'll complain anyway!"
"The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!"
Really big jobs meeting today at the White House! 3 P.M.
"I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!"
"The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear.."
".proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problemsbut they can ALL be solved!"
Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn? This is classic!
"My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy, such a great loss. May God be with you all!"
"China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field"
.The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due we are raising rates Really?
Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!
"I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!"
"The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again can't believe it! Isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!"
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!
"The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the '16 Election never ends!"
"No Collusion, No Obstruction but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!"
"Troy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime Borders. Troy is the total opposite, and loves our Military, Vets 2nd Amendment. EARLY VOTING just started with Election Day on August 7th. Troy has my Full Total Endorsement!"
"Andrew McCarthy 'I said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.' On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!"
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!
"So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn't he do something about it? Why didn't he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that's why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!"
"To Iranian President Rouhani NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!"
"So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!"
"When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!"
"A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise, no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy!"
"The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their 'delivery boy' for a BIG percentage of their packages."
.In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
"Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never!"
"Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It's as simple as that and everybody's talking! Remember, we are the 'piggy bank' that's being robbed. All will be Great!"
Our Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!
Heading to Missouri to be with many of my great friends. VFW here we come!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready but they won't!"
"So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn't approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!"
"Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!"
"When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!"
"China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year."
"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so? Too bad!"
"Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow, 6930, those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!"
The United States and the European Union have a $1 TRILLION bilateral trade relationship the largest economic relationship in the world. We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens
"Sergio Marchionne, who passed away today, was one of the most brilliant successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford. It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS, he loved the car industry, and fought hard for it. He will be truly missed!"
"Thank you very much, working hard!"
along quickly. European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them. There was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!
"Thank you Georgia! They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp, in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! Two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to Brian!"
Great to be back on track with the European Union. This was a big day for free and fair trade!
"European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also, they will be buying vast amounts of LNG!"

"Heading to Dubuque, Iowa and then Granite City, Illinois. Looking forward to being with many great friends!"
"The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a great Christian, family man and wonderful human being. He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately!"

"The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States! After so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to Kim Jong Un."
"Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion"
".,the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country.And so the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO,."
"..I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!"
GREAT GDP numbers just released. Will be having a news conference soon!

We have accomplished an economic turnaround of HISTORIC proportions!

"Democrats, who want Open Borders and care little about Crime, are incompetent, but they have the Fake News Media almost totally on their side!"
"The only things the Democrats do well is 'Resist,' which is their campaign slogan, and 'Obstruct.' Cryin' Chuck Schumer has almost 400 great American people that are waiting 'forever' to serve our Country! A total disgrace. Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved!"
"Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!"
"Please understand, there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally, whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote 'R"
"Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!"
"The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and, of course, the historically low unemployment numbers, especially for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Women."
"I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!"
"dying newspaper industry. No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people! As an example, the failing New York Times"
and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change!
"There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!"
".Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama.And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity real Russian Collusion on the Democrats sidePodesta, Dossier?"
"We must have Border Security, get rid of Chain, Lottery, Catch Release Sanctuary Cities go to Merit based Immigration. Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and, of course, keep building, but much faster, THE WALL!"

MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks more. I made.."

"I don't care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown"
"Border Security is National Security, and National Security is the longterm viability of our Country. A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America!"
"On my way to Tampa, Florida. Look forward to seeing everyone soon!"
"FBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. He needed an insurance policy. Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election. He should never, ever been allowed to.."
..remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won't go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.' ALAN DERSHOWITZ.
"..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!"
"Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion a Hoax!"
"Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and 'Public Enemy Number One,' or Paul Manafort, political operative Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?"

When the House and Senate meet on the very important Farm Bill we love our farmers hopefully they will be able to leave the WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD STAMPS PROVISION that the House approved. Senate should go to 51 votes!

"Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. China market has dropped 27% in last 4months, and they are talking to us. Our market is stronger than ever, and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated. America First."
".Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry. Plants are opening all over the U.S., Steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury. Other countries use Tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream!"
".Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way"
".China, which is for the first time doing poorly against us, is spending a fortune on ads and P.R. trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs because they are really hurting their economy. Likewise other countries. We are Winning, but must be strong!"

The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it's TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous sick!
"Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come,Tax them. If they don't want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth.."
"..Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. At minimum, we will make much better Trade Deals for our country!"
"Why aren't Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!"
Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS!
"Presidential Approval numbers are very good strong economy, military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point, by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave, but there might be a Red Wave!"

California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!
"The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"
"When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov."

"The NFL players are at it again taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem. Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their 'outrage' at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love"
"..Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!"

Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman. Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!
"Why isn't the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won't give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.."
"..Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!"

"The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary the DNC."
.Do you believe Nelly worked for Fusion and her husband STILL WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 'JUSTICE.' I have never seen anything so Rigged in my life. Our A.G. is scared stiff and Missing in Action. It is all starting to be revealed not pretty. IG Report soon? Witch Hunt!
"Wacky Omarosa, who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice, now got fired for the last time. She never made it, never will. She begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, I said Ok. People in the White House hated her. She was vicious, but not smart. I would rarely see her but heard."
"really bad things. Nasty to people would constantly miss meetings work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me until she got fired!"
"While I know it's 'not presidential' to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!"
"Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI finally. The list of bad players in the FBI DOJ gets longer longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction I just fight back!"
"Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!"

Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch 'The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else. There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI. We know this
".should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.' Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn't have said it better myself!"
"When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!"

"Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!"
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt why isn't this socalled 'probe' ended immediately? Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?

"Our Economy is doing better than ever. Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before, companies earnings are higher than ever, inflation is low business optimism is higher than it has ever been. For the first time in many decades, we are protecting our workers!"
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country.BUT WE ARE WINNING!
"The Boston Globe, which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses investment), or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR. Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT!"
"There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants, but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!"
"The Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, is dead. She was a great woman, with a wonderful gift from God, her voice. She will be missed!"
"Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor, who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on Turkey!"
The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).' Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.
"How can 'Senator' Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? Loser!"
".An incredibly corrupt FBI DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election. Brennan has gone off the deep end, he's disgraced and discredited himself. His conduct has been outrageous.' Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch."
"In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. 'Stop quarterly reporting go to a six month system,' said one. That would allow greater flexibility save money. I have asked the SEC to study!"
"How does a politician, Cuomo, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state, not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S., survive making the statement, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse?"
"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up! I will instead"
".attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date, go to the Paris parade, celebrating the end of the War, on November 11th. Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!"
The U.S. has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago.
"Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America's lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again, just look at the markets, jobs, military setting records, and we will do even better. Andrew 'choked' badly, mistake!"
"When a politician admits that 'We're not going to make America great again,' there doesn't seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo, with many wanting him to resignhe will get higher ratings than his brother Chris!"
"Which is worse, Hightax Andrew Cuomo's statement, 'WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT' or Hillary Clinton's 'DEPLORABLES' statement"
"I say Andrew's was a bigger and more incompetent blunder. He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress, but his political career is over!"
"Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it's astonishing that he's still employed. Bruce Nelly Ohr's bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling. He doesn't disclose it under Fed Regs. Using your Federal office for personal."
"..Censorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN MSNBC, yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don't watch at all.."
".Too many voices are being destroyed, some good some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen. Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Let everybody participate, good bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!"
"All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China. But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!"
"Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!"
"The Economy is stronger and better than ever before. Importantly, there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time!"
"The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria. Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U.S. I want to develop the U.S., our military and countries that help us!"
"I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!"
.and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side Media is even worse!
"No Collusion and No Obstruction, except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Strzok lies to Congress, or Crooked's Emails!"
"The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite  the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!"
"Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward. From the day I announced, the Times has been Fake News, and with their disgusting new Board Member, it will only get worse!"
"Study the late Joseph McCarthy, because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby! Rigged Witch Hunt!"
"Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone."
".looking for trouble. They are enjoying ruining people's lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side the lies, the firings, the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller's Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!"
"Where's the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion, and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt, they scream Obstruction!"
"I hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country's history, brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won't sue!"
"Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn't because of the good job he did! He is a political 'hack."
"Will Bruce Ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited Dossier, ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions 'Justice' Department? A total joke!"
"It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can, and must, END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!"
"Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person, A.G. Patrick Morrisey, who is running for the U.S. Senate. Patrick has great Energy StaminaI need his VOTE to MAGA. Total Endorsement!"
"I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party's California Gubernatorial Candidate, John Cox. He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes Crime. He will Make California Great Again make you proud of your Great State again. Total Endorsement!"
A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength!
Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails. Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn't lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress!
"Fake News, of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired New Yorker) falsely reported that I was going to take the extraordinary step of denying Intelligence Briefings to President Obama. Never discussed or thought of!"
"I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY! If there were no serious consequences, our country would be overrun with people trying to get in, and our system could not handle it!"
"Big Rally tonight in West Virginia. Patrick Morrisey is running a GREAT race for U.S. Senate. I have done so much for West Virginia, against all odds, and having Patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier. See you later. CLEAN COAL!!!!"

Thank you West Virginia. I love you!
"If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!"
"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!"
"A large number of counts, ten, could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case. Witch Hunt!"
Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!
"Longest bull run in the history of the stock market, congratulations America!"
"The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is, they forgot to campaign in numerous states!"

"ExNSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over 'classified' information. Gee, this is 'small potatoes' compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard."
"Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!"
"I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"
"Additionally, because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place)"
"Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!"
Congratulations to new Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. There are no greater friends than the United States and Australia!
Jeff Sessions said he wouldn't allow politics to influence him only because he doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion!
"Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!"

NASDAQ has just gone above 8000 for the first time in history!
I smile at Senators and others talking about how good free trade is for the U.S. What they don't say is that we lose Jobs and over 800 Billion Dollars a year on really dumb Trade Deals.and these same countries Tariff us to death. These lawmakers are just fine with this!

"Martha McSally, running in the Arizona Primary for U.S. Senate, was endorsed by rejected Senator Jeff Flake.and turned it down a first! Now Martha, a great U.S. Military fighter jet pilot and highly respected member of Congress, WINS BIG. Congratulations, and on to November!"
"Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dream.a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs!"

How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful! Witch Hunt!

"of money on joint U.S.South Korea war games. Besides, the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea, and Japan, if he so chooses. If he does, they will be far bigger than ever before. As for the U.S.China trade disputes, and other"
"I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn't matter to them, they only have their hatred agenda. This includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!"
"The news from the Financial Markets is even better than anticipated. For all of you that have made a fortune in the markets, or seen your 401k's rise beyond your wildest expectations, more good news is coming!"
"Wow, Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr's wife, is a Russia expert who is fluent in Russian. She worked for Fusion GPS where she was paid a lot. Collusion! Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is, unbelievably, still there!"
"The Rigged Russia Witch Hunt did not come into play, even a little bit, with respect to my decision on Don McGahn!"
"I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel! I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!"

".Remember, NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made. The U.S. lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. We were far better off before NAFTA should never have been signed. Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for. We make new deal or go back to preNAFTA!"

"Richard Trumka, the head of the AFLCIO, represented his union poorly on television this weekend. Some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country, and the success of the U.S. itself, that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly. A Dem!"
"Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the MidTerms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff"
".The Democrats, none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions, must love him now. Same thing with Lyin' James Comey. The Dems all hated him, wanted him out, thought he was disgusting UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man, a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!"
"I see that John Kerry, the father of the now terminated Iran deal, is thinking of running for President. I should only be so lucky although the field that is currently assembling looks really good FOR ME!"

"The already discredited Woodward book, so many lies and phony sources, has me calling Jeff Sessions 'mentally retarded' and 'a dumb southerner.' I said NEITHER, never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being a southerner is a GREAT thing. He made this up to divide!"

The Woodward book is a scam. I don't talk the way I am quoted. If I did I would not have been elected President. These quotes were made up. The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle. I wish the people could see the real facts and our country is doing GREAT!

"If the Democrats had won the Election in 2016, GDP, which was about 1% and going down, would have been minus 4% instead of up 4.2%. I opened up our beautiful economic engine with Regulation and Tax Cuts. Our system was choking and would have been made worse. Still plenty to do!"

More text messages between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI DOJ. This should never have happened but we are learning more and more by the hour. 'Others were leaking like mad' in order to get the President! ..
"3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000"
"..This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!"
"The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs making products at home. If we meet, we meet?"
Senator Debbie Stabenow and the Democrats are totally against approving the Farm Bill. They are fighting tooth and nail to not allow our Great Farmers to get what they so richly deserve. Work requirements are imperative and the Dems are a NO. Not good!

"Great job FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement not easy, very dangerous, tremendous talent. America is proud of you. Keep it all going finish strong!"

"When will Republican leadership learn that they are being played like a fiddle by the Democrats on Border Security and Building the Wall? Without Borders, we don't have a country. With Open Borders, which the Democrats want, we have nothing but crime! Finish the Wall!"
Five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to hurricane Florence! Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. May God be with them!
"The illegal Mueller Witch Hunt continues in search of a crime. There was never Collusion with Russia, except by the Clinton campaign, so the 17 Angry Democrats are looking at anything they can find. Very unfair and BAD for the country. ALSO, not allowed under the LAW!"

"Our Steel Industry is the talk of the World. It has been given new life, and is thriving. Billions of Dollars is being spent on new plants all around the country!"
"Immediately after Comey's firing Peter Strzok texted to his lover, Lisa Page 'We need to Open the case we've been waiting on now while Andy (McCabe, also fired) is acting. Page answered, 'We need to lock in (redacted). In a formal chargeable way. Soon.' Wow, a conspiracy caught?"

"Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally."
"Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them."

I agree with President Obama 100%!

"The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually, it is their Fake Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!"

Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania. Thank you Keith!
"CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the 'Media is the Enemy of the People.' Wrong! I said that the 'Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People,' a very big difference. When you give out false information not good!"
"Check out tweets from last two days. I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People but dishonest reporters use only the word 'Media.' The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News. They get it, and fully understand!"

The World is using our laws to our detriment. They laugh at the Stupidity they see!
Republicans will protect people with preexisting conditions far better than the Dems!

"Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship!"

"Heading to Pensacola, Florida will be there soon. Amazing lines of people wanting to get in what a crowd! Is this a sign of Republican Strength on Tuesday?"
"John James, running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan, is a spectacular young star of the future. We should make him a star of the present. A distinguished West Point Grad and Vet, people should Vote Out Schumer Puppet Debbie Stabenow, who does nothing for Michigan!"
Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal. He works hard and is respected by all he produces! Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military Vets!

REMEMBER FLORIDA I have been President of the United States for almost two years. During that time Senator Bill Nelson didn't call me once. Rick Scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for Florida. Did a GREAT job on hurricanes. VOTE SCOTT!

"To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words FAKE NEWS!"
"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!"

"According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the socalled Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about!"

"Jeff Flake(y) doesn't want to protect the NonSenate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the 'crime' of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!"
"Rick Scott was up by 50,000 votes on Election Day, now they 'found' many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. 'The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?"
Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him 'back into play.' Bill Nelson conceded Election now he's back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!
"In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a 'number,' couldn't do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!"
"Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!"
"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!"
"Matthew G. Whitaker is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney from Iowa. He was chosen by Jeff Sessions to be his Chief of Staff. I did not know Mr. Whitaker. Likewise, as Chief, I did not know Mr. Whitaker except primarily as he traveled with A.G. Sessions. No social contact"

"These California fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80100 acres a minute). If people don't evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire. Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials!"

"Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders. Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasn't, on both Military and Trade. We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection,.."
"..hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue It is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the United States. Massive amounts.."

"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possibleballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!"

"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One Two How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!"
"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!"
"The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud peopleand rightfully so!.."

"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't"
".care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!"
"Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side?"
"The only 'Collusion' is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don't have it. Check out how biased Facebook, Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That's the real Collusion!"
"Last year, I signed the landmark VA Accountability Act to ensure those who mistreat our Veterans can be held fully accountable. Since my inauguration, we have removed more than 3,600 government employees who were not giving our Vets the care they deserve."

"People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate, and epic victory 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents."

".their country's flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it!"
Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future a force to reckon with!

"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is illprepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.' Likewise, the U.S. is illprepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!"
"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security Wall NOW!"
From day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!
Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars they never told us he was living there. Fools!..
".We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That's ENDING!"
The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence. This is what it really looks like no climbers anymore under our Administration!
"Socalled comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents' Dinner that this year, for the first time in decades, they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! Maybe I will go?"

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is why"
"..are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!"
"There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. Not good!"
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS Whatever happened to Global Warming?

HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!
"Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security"
".and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death. We want the Constitution as written!"

"Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit. Nevertheless, they are working hard to make America a safer place, though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins!"
"Republicans and Democrats MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall. After 40 years of talk, it is finally time for action. Fix the Border, for once and for all, NOW!"
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally. Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain. No 'Releasing' into the U.S
".All will stay in Mexico. If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!"
"I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo, Mississippi, on Monday night doing two Rallies for Senator HydeSmith, who has a very important Election on Tuesday. She is an outstanding person who is strong on the Border, Crime, Military, our great Vets, Healthcare the 2nd A. Needed in D.C."
The large and violent French protests don't take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.
"Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings!"
"So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!"
"Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection. The European Union, for many years, has taken advantage of us on Trade, and then they don't live up to their Military commitment through NATO. Things must change fast!"
Clinton Foundation donations drop 42% which shows that they illegally played the power game. They monetized their political influence through the Foundation. 'During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation.' Andrew McCarthy
"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!"
"When Mueller does his final report, will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble, will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those 'on the other side'(whatever happened to Podesta?), and will he be putting in statements from.."
".hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met, saw or spoke to a Russian during this period? So many campaign workers, people inside from the beginning, ask me why they have not been called (they want to be). There was NO Collusion Mueller knows it!"
"On the tenyear anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack, the U.S. stands with the people of India in their quest for justice. The attack killed 166 innocents, including six Americans. We will never let terrorists win, or even come close to winning!"
"While CNN doesn't do great in the United States based on ratings, outside of the U.S. they have very little competition. Throughout the world, CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair."
".and false way. Something has to be done, including the possibility of the United States starting our own Worldwide Network to show the World the way we really are, GREAT!"
"The Phony Witch Hunt continues, but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie. Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue."
".The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite. He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System, where he is only looking at one side and not the other. Heroes will come of this, and it won't be Mueller and his"
".terrible Gang of Angry Democrats. Look at their past, and look where they come from. The now $30,000,000 Witch Hunt continues and they've got nothing but ruined lives. Where is the Server? Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and 'Justice' Department!"
Polls are open in Mississippi. We need Cindy HydeSmith in Washington. GO OUT AND VOTE. Thanks!
.for electric cars. General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) don't think that bet is going to pay off. I am here to protect America's Workers!
"The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don't want to look at the DNC Server), but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!"
"Brenda Snipes, in charge of voting in Broward County, Florida, was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it. Just kidding, she is a fine, very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!"
Congratulations to Senator Cindy HydeSmith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi. We are all very proud of you!
"While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!"
"The reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go to favorite is that, for many years, Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the 'chicken tax.' If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here.."
"..and G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan Maryland. Get smart Congress. Also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President has great power on this issue Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!"
"Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that will create 600 goodpaying U.S. JOBS. Steel JOBS are coming back to America, just like I predicted. Congratulations to Steel Dynamics!"
"Sebastian Gorka, a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House, has just written an excellent book, 'Why We Fight.' Much will be learned from this very good read!"
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!
"General Motors is very counter to what other auto, and other, companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW, which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming!"
"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious, and perhaps subversive, crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace!"
"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever endor will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thingthere was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!"
"Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China, and there is a long way to go. If companies don't want to pay Tariffs, build in the U.S.A. Otherwise, lets just make our Country richer than ever before!"
"Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting."
.in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin. I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!
.They have really done a great job in capturing my longheld views and ideas. This book is on sale now a terrific read of a really interesting subject!
"As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength. I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 reelect, because there is no one better for the job!"
Alan Dershowitz 'These are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I don't see any evidence of crimes.' This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately. Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. Where is the IG REPORT?
Arrived in Argentina with a very busy two days planned. Important meetings scheduled throughout. Our great Country is extremely well represented. Will be very productive!
"Oh, I get it! I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President continue to run my businessvery legal very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail"
".Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn't do the project. Witch Hunt!"
"Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in U.S. and World History. The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!"
To the Great people of Alaska. You have been hit hard by a 'big one.' Please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you. Your Federal Government will spare no expense. God Bless you ALL!
Great reviews on the USMCA sooo much better than NAFTA!
"President George H.W. Bush led a long, successful and beautiful life. Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family. His accomplishments were great from beginning to end. He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all!"
I was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving Argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20.
".However, out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference."
China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.
"My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!"
"Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China. They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants. Farmers, I LOVE YOU!"
"President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!"
"I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!"
"We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also, STOP THE DRUGS!"
".his wife and fatherinlaw (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence."
"Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, don't want the truth, they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!"
Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H.W. Bush.
Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today. The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania. The elegance precision of the last two days have been remarkable!
"The negotiations with China have already started. Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina. Bob Lighthizer will be working closely with Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro.."
"on seeing whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible. If it is, we will get it done. China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately. President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember,"
".I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN"
"..But if a fair deal is able to be made with China, one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done, I will happily sign. Let the negotiations begin. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!"
.in the world. I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America's environment. But American taxpayers and American workers shouldn't pay to clean up others countries' pollution.
"We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal either now or into the future."
..China does not want Tariffs!
"Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!"
One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States. It will now be considered a 'controlled substance.' This could be a game changer on what is.
"..considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all. Last year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl. If China cracks down on this 'horror drug,' using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!"
"Looking forward to being with the Bush family. This is not a funeral, this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. He will be missed!"
"Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!"
"Working hard, thank you!"
"Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax Regulation Cuts, Judge's, Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen. It's called Presidential Harassment!"
"Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans, with the very important help of my campaign Rallies, WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 53 to 47? All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House. Senate alone approves judges others. Big Republican Win!"
Statement from China 'The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.' I agree!
TrishRegan 'Did the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I don't think so. The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. Don't use Government resources to take down political foes. Weaponizing Government for gain.' Is this really America? Witch Hunt!
FAKE NEWS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
"Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NONWALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!"
"Robert Mueller and Leakin' Lyin' James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest. And bye the way, wasn't the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of 'legal' at the corrupt Clinton Foundation? A total Witch Hunt"
".Will Robert Mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report. Will Andrew Weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report. He wrongly destroyed people's lives, took down great companies, only to be.."
"..overturned, 90, in the United States Supreme Court. Doing same thing to people now. Will all of the substantial many contributions made by the 17 Angry Democrats to the Campaign of Crooked Hillary be listed in top of Report. Will the people that worked for the Clinton."
".Foundation be listed at the top of the Report? Will the scathing document written about Lyin' James Comey, by the man in charge of the case, Rod Rosenstein (who also signed the FISA Warrant), be a big part of the Report? Isn't Rod therefore totally conflicted? Will all of."
"the lying and leaking by the people doing the Report, also Bruce Ohr (and his lovely wife Molly), Comey, Brennan, Clapper, all of the many fired people of the FBI, be listed in the Report? Will the corruption within the DNC Clinton Campaign be exposed?..And so much more!"
China talks are going very well!
"It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report. That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report."
We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!
"I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!"
I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating The Honorable William P. Barr for the position of Attorney General of the United States. As the former AG for George H.W. Bush.
".and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!"
"Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn't have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn't get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!"
"Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform. It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!"
It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration. Force him to answer the questions under oath!
Totally clears the President. Thank you!
"The idea of a European Military didn't work out too well in W.W. I or 2. But the U.S. was there for you, and always will be. All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO. Germany is paying 1% while the U.S. pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP to protect Europe. Fairness!"
"AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION!"
"I am pleased to announce my nomination of fourstar General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the United States Army as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing General Joe Dunford, who will be retiring."
.I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country! Date of transition to be determined.
Very sad day night in Paris. Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!
"Watched Da Nang Dick Blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in Vietnam (which he never saw). As the bullets whizzed by Da Nang Dicks head, as he was saving soldiers."
".left and right, he then woke up from his dream screaming that HE LIED. Next time I go to Vietnam I will ask 'the Dick' to travel with me!"
"Great honor to be headed to the ArmyNavy game today. Will be there shortly, landing now!"
"On 245 occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn't know, didn't recall, or couldn't remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) didn't know who signed off and didn't know Christopher Steele. All lies!"
Leakin' James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!
".which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!"
"James Comey's behind closed doors testimony reveals that 'there was not evidence of Campaign Collusion' with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words, the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!"
"Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls Fences, or Border Patrol Officers Military. They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries."
"..Ice, Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border. A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats,.."
".however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way."
"..I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built"
".People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!"
Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!
"Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!"
"James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020. In other words, he is and has been a Democrat. Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!"
I don't care what you think of the Presidentit cannot bleed over to the FBIComey is confirming there is bias in the FBI' Chris Swecker
Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week! These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars. It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.
Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!
"The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can't give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?"
"I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.' This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly antiUSA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!"
"I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called 'advice of counsel,' and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. That is why they get paid. Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly"
".stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not"
".guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he didincluding the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!"
They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated the FBI said he didn't lie and they overrode the FBI. They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. Sad!
WITCH HUNT!
"If it was a Conservative that said what 'crazed' Mika Brzezinski stated on her show yesterday, using a certain horrible term, that person would be banned permanently from television."
"Let's not do a shutdown, Democrats do what's right for the American People!"
"China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!"
"Many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with North Korea I always reply by saying we are in no hurry, there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country."
.Kim Jong Un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people. We are doing just fine!
"I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration."
.I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! John will be staying until the end of the year. He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service!
"For the record, there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!"
"As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects preexisting conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!"
"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!"
"Never in the history of our Country has the 'press' been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good, are bad. Stories that should be bad, are horrible. Many stories, like with the REAL story on Russia, Clinton the DNC, seldom get reported. Too bad!"
"The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!"
"Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!"
"A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can't be legal? Only defame belittle! Collusion?"
"So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!"
"Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE! Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked's office?"
"The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages the Obama years. However, if you don't separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!"
".a persecution of the President.' Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal. Thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this Witch Hunt is all about. Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!"
".The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the 'insurance policy' long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country. They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!"
"The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!"
"It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!"
"Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!"
Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than everwe stand with our Farmers!
"Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!"
"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!"
"I hope the people over at the Fed will read today's Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B's. Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!"
Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?
"Russia Dossier reporter now doubts dopey Christopher Steele's claims! 'When you get into the details of the Steele Dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them. There's good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.."
".WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.' Thank you to Michael Isikoff, Yahoo, for honesty. What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately. Also, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary DNC!"
"Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims. The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX, but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?"
"The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it."
".It will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve. It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed!"
"America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes. Congratulations to the Senate on the bipartisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill."
".This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved. I look forward to signing this into law!"
"In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!"
"Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!"
"sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation"
".In any event, it goes on and on the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people a total double standard of 'justice."
"After historic victories against ISIS, it's time to bring our great young people home!"
"I'm proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.' Senator Rand Paul. 'I couldn't agree more with the presidents decision. By definition, this is the opposite of an Obama decision. Senator Mike Lee"
"Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight.."
".Russia, Iran, Syria many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us. I am building by far the most powerful military in the world. ISIS hits us they are doomed!"
"The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!"
"With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well, they didn't get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!"
"When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn't happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!"
"So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran other locals? Time to focus on our Country bring our youth back home where they belong!"
"General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years. During Jim's tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting."
.equipment. General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!
Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!
"Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn't have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!"
"Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen. If enough Dems don't vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!"
"The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else's that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It's like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, technology.."
"..on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don't. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!"
"No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you!"
"The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don't want Open Borders and Crime!"
"House Republican Vote, 217185."
Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!
"Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall, or Fence, and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done, one way or the other!"
"Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!"
"There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia Never, just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture."
"General Anthony Tata, author, 'Dark Winter.' I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS."
The Democrats now own the shutdown!
I've done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents.not even close!
A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!
Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America's Southern Border!
Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!
OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!
"I am in the White House, working hard. News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking more) but it could be a long stay. On Syria, we were originally"
".going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!"
Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security.
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!
"I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless costly foreign wars also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries, but we won't fight for the borders of our own!"
Senate adjourns until December 27th.
"Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"
"When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationshipbut I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very importantbut not when they take advantage of U.S."
"The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!"
"I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, previously Boeing. He will be great!"
Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia. More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. We are praying for recovery and healing. America is with you!
"We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is 'the mistake' of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!"
"Senator Bob Corker just stated that, 'I'm so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and that's what I told the people of our state that's what I'd do, serve for two terms.' But that is Not True wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn't endorse him.."
"Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best most productive of his career. Tax Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships much more. Great!"
"The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can't have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!"
"The President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.' Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!"
"Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed!"
"To those few Senators who think I don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO. What I don't like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade"
".We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!"
"For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker."
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!
"The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch he can't putt!"
"I never 'lashed out' at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S., a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media!"
"The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!"
"Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!"
I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!
Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!
"I am in the Oval Office just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, lives, will be saved!"
Merry Christmas!
"Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country people that know how to win!"
"Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?"
"The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record!"
"The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal and that's where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall."
"Border Patrol Agents want the Wall.' Democrat's say they don't want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don't want ICE. They don't have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!"
There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!
"Brad Blakeman 'The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look, this is your neighborhood, you've got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don't always look to America."
"CNN others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!"
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress President who would approve!
".The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation.' We build a Wall or.."
"..close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to preNAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border"
"..Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries taking advantage of U.S. for years!"
"The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!"
"I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!"
"Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!"
"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can't. If we had a Wall, they wouldn't even try! The two.."
"children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn't given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard getting so little credit!"
"Absolutely nothing' (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!"
"President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!"
"An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!"
"I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!"
"..Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember!"
"I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an 'Open Wound,' where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!"
"I am the only person in America who could say that, 'I'm bringing our great troops back home, with victory,' and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy!"
"I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!"
"It's incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn't work. It does, and properly built, almost 100%! They say it's old technology but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!"
Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from.
".Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!"
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
"MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico Canada will also thrive good for all!"
"The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security the Tech 'stuff' is just, by comparison, meaningless bells whistles"
Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!
"Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, 'Why We Fight.' Lots of insight Enjoy!"
"HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!"
Happy New Year!
"The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!"
One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!
Border Security and the Wall 'thing' and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?
Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!
"Do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!"
"For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but can't because Dems are blocking them, some for two yearshistoric record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!"
"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player WIN!"
Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!
Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people this is the first and most important duty of government
"I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"
"Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!"
The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!
"As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!"
"How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?"
GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!
"The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I'm sure he is a fine man, but I don't know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!"
Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law passed in a very bipartisan way!
"Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!"
"The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!"
"Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!"
"I don't care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?"
"We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL! In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem."
"The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don't want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!"
"Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country!"
"V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!"
"APNORC POLL 'Immigration among the top concerns in 2019.' People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now, rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!"
"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked' Barrack Obama, 2005. I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in' Hillary Clinton, 2015."
".The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!"
Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President ElSisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!
"Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal alBadawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!"
"V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A."
"With all of the success that our Country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the Fake News totally dishonest Media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. Many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the TRUTH!"
.The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!
"Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, 'Yes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It's been done a number of times.' No doubt, but let's get our deal done in Congress!"
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.."
I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 900 P.M. Eastern.
"Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!"
"Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election!"
"The President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.' Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers"
Talks with China are going very well!
"Congratulations to a truly great football team, the Clemson Tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the W.H."
Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!
"Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice Accountability. Economy GDP are strong. Tax Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!"
"Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives money!"
"Thank you to all of America's brave police, deputies, sheriffs, and federal law enforcement on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! We love you and will always support you."
"Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said byebye, nothing else works!"
"The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!"
"Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!"
"Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I 'slammed the table walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.' Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said byebye and left, no slamming!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"President Obama, thank you for your great support I have been saying this all along!"
From the Southern Border.
"We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!"
When I took the Oath of Office.
"I often said during rallies, with little variation, that 'Mexico will pay for the Wall.' We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!"
"H1B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S."
"Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! I have been there numerous times The Democrats, Cryin' Chuck and Nancy don't know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY."
"The Steel Barrier, or Wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!"
"The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven't built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anticlimbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service!"
"I look forward to hosting, right out of the great State of South Carolina, the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday, January 14th. What a game, what a coach, what a team!"
"Drug prices declined in 2018, the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration, Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!"
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!"
"Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged botched Crooked Hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didn't know anything (a lie),."
.the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comey's poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop
"..who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, the 13 Angry Democrats leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!"
"I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!"
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
"Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!"
"23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!"
Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
"I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is 'chaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.' The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there's almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and"
".I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!"
We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their 'vacations' and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!
"Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don't want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch!"
The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!
"I'm in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!"
"The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"
"Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE!"
"Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone."
".Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!"
"So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better more responsible hands!"
"If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!"
"Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, 'Thank you for being here. I'm glad you're here' It's their house, he's supposed to be there!"
".Border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States, as we have known it, is going to cease to existAnd Americans will not go gentle into that good night. Patrick Buchanan. The great people of our Country demand proper Border Security NOW!"
I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!
"Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"
"The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. Amazing to watch as certain people covering me, and the tremendous success of this administration, have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill!"
"Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS, and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. Turkey great potential to substantially expand!"
"For decades, politicians promised to secure the border, fix our trade deals, bring back our factories, get tough on China, move the Embassy to Jerusalem, make NATO pay their fair share, and so much else only to do NOTHING (or worse)."
".I am doing exactly what I pledged to do, and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country. Just as I promised, I am fighting for YOU!"
The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin' James Comey and the socalled 'leaders' of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!
"Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low, really good news for our Vets and their families. Will soon be an all time low! Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?"
"Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win!"
"A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!"
"Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border. Numbers are going up fast, over 50%. Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they don't want Border Security!"
Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?
"Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!"
"There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!"
The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty!
So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times UNTIL I FIRED HIM!
"Gregg Jarrett 'Mueller's prosecutors knew the 'Dossier' was the product of bias and deception.' It was a Fake, just like so much news coverage in our Country. Nothing but a Witch Hunt, from beginning to end!"
"Border rancher 'We've found prayer rugs out here. It's unreal.' Washington Examiner People coming across the Southern Border from many countries, some of which would be a big surprise."
"Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. Also, could somebody please explain to Nancy her 'big donors' in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!"
Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!
"Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No 'Cave' on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see, especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border, High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals Drugs now!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
AMERICA FIRST!
"Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited 'Dossier,' paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research), on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!"
Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!
"Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election leadup), as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story the even more disgraceful coverage!"
"Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two many are still in Mexico but can't get through our Wall, but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy!"
I will be live from the White House at 400 P.M.
"Always heard that as President, 'it's all about the economy!' Well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP, lowest unemployment, companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers, great new trade deals happening, more. But LITTLE media mention!"
Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!
"Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don't see crime drugs, they only see 2020 which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country allow people to go back to work."
"No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegallybut be careful Nancy!"
"Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the 'lefties' in her party that she has lost controlAnd by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!"
"Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, I'll get back to you soon!"
"Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall."
"Don't forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!"
The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February!
"To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!"
"Congratulations to Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and the entire New England Patriots team on a great game and season. Will be a fantastic Super Bowl!"
"Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997, or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S., 'you would need a magic wand.' I guess I found the MAGIC WAND and it is only getting better!"
"China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!"
"If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are 'immoral,' why isn't she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico, even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked 'strangers' just flow into the U.S."
Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!
"Democrats are kidding themselves (they don't really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime, Drugs, Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!"
"Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!"
"Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!"
"FBI top lawyer confirms 'unusual steps.' They relied on the Clinton Campaign's Fake Unverified 'Dossier,' which is illegal. 'That has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, and that's what they did to the President.' Judge Napolitano"
"Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!"
"The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World, by far!"
"The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly hence, the term, Fake News!"
"Great unity in the Republican Party. Want to, once and for all, put an end to stoppable crime and drugs! Border Security and Wall. No doubt!"
"BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme, for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now), of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!"
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL!
"As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. I am not looking for an."
".alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. I look forward to giving a 'great' State of the Union Address in the near future!"
"A great new book just out, 'Game of Thorns,' by Doug Wead, Presidential Historian and best selling author. The book covers the campaign of 2016, and what could be more exciting than that?"
"So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen, who sadly will not be testifying before Congress, is using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton to represent him Gee, how did that happen? Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI wasn't sworn in, no tape, nothing?"
"The Fake News Media loves saying 'so little happened at my first summit with Kim Jong Un.' Wrong! After 40 years of doing nothing with North Korea but being taken to the cleaners, with a major war ready to start, in a short 15 months, relationships built, hostages remains."
"back home where they belong, no more Rockets or M's being fired over Japan or anywhere else and, most importantly, no Nuclear Testing. This is more than has ever been accomplished with North Korea, and the Fake News knows it. I expect another good meeting soon, much potential!"
Without a Wall there cannot be safety and security at the Border or for the U.S.A. BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL!
"Nancy just said she 'just doesn't understand why?' Very simply, without a Wall it all doesn't work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime, Human Trafficking, Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!"
Great earnings coming out of Stock Market. Too bad Media doesn't devote much time to this!
"Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there?"
"I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it's off to the races!"
"If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress, what about the lying done by Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Lisa Page lover, Baker and soooo many others? What about Hillary to FBI and her 33,000 deleted Emails? What about Lisa Peter's deleted texts Wiener's laptop? Much more!"
"I like the fact that the President is making the case (Border Security Crime) to the American people. Now we know where Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer the Democrats stand, which is no Border Security. Will be big 2020 issue.' Matt Schlapp, Chair, ACU. Bigger than anyone knows!"
"21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border through dialogue. We will build the Wall!"
"We have turned away, at great expense, two major Caravans, but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldn't even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!"
"Thank you to the Republican National Committee, (the RNC), who voted UNANIMOUSLY yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 Election. Considering that we have done more than any Administration in the first two years, this should be easy. More great things now in the works!"
"We absolutely need a physical barrier or Wall, whatever you want to call it. The President yesterday laid all that out. We need to do it all, including the Wall. I provided the same information to the previous administration, it was ignored.' Mark Morgan, Border Chief for 'O'!"
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL!
"Only fools, or people with a political agenda, don't want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will happen it always does!"
"Ax falls quickly at BuzzFeed and Huffpost!' Headline, New York Post. Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. Sadly, many others will follow. The people want the Truth!"
.about all of the one sided Fake Media coverage (collusion with Crooked H?) that I had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign. What about the now revealed bias by Facebook and many others. Roger Stone didn't even work for me anywhere near the Election!
WITCH HUNT!
"We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS"
"Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. It's called burden sharing. Also, more united. Dems Fake News like to portray the opposite!"
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL!
"After all that I have done for the Military, our great Veterans, Judges (99), Justices (2), Tax Regulation Cuts, the Economy, Energy, Trade MUCH MORE, does anybody really think I won't build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Tariffs on the 'dumping' of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry. New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry, but created many jobs. Also, billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S."
"Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!"
"In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!"
"How does Da Nang Dick (Blumenthal) serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee when he defrauded the American people about his so called War Hero status in Vietnam, only to later admit, with tears pouring down his face, that he was never in Vietnam. An embarrassment to our Country!"
A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a nondisclosure agreement. He is a mess!
Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues. Guaido is being targeted by Venezuelan Supreme Court. Massive protest expected today. Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice.
"When I became President, ISIS was out of control in Syria running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.."
".Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization"
"Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being madebig difference!"
"If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!"
"The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but."
".a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!"
"Dow just broke 25,000. Tremendous news!"
Spoke today with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong United States support for Venezuela's fight to regain its democracy.
.Large protests all across Venezuela today against Maduro. The fight for freedom has begun!
"So great to watch listen to all these people who write books talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning, and how I should be doing 'IT.' As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around, say 'gee, I'm in the White House, they're not!"
"Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally, after many decades, properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other!"
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!
China's top trade negotiators are in the U.S. meeting with our representatives. Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. They are correct. I will be
".meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction."
".China's representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal, leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table. All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved. Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st, so all working hard to complete by that date!"
"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I've got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don't expect much help!"
"Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!"
"More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans, into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans, and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!"
"Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services, which they are now doing, but also to our Manufacturing, Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!"
Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place but now good!
"Very sadly, Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017, to 33,341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crisis taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built!"
"Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media and we are very much in agreement on Iran, ISIS, North Korea, etc. Their testimony was distorted press."
".I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page!"
"Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country's history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!"
"Nellie Ohr, the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr, was long ago investigating for pay (GPS Fusion) members of my family, feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the FBI, even though it was created by ousted discredited Christopher Steele. Illegal! WITCH HUNT"
"I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the 'Endless Wars' of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace"
".after 18 long years. Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along. We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate, but will be watching them closely. It is now time to start coming home and, after many years, spending our money wisely. Certain people must get smart!"
"Best January for the DOW in over 30 years. We have, by far, the strongest economy in the world!"
Thank you to Senator Rob Portman and Senator Cory Gardner for the early and warm endorsement. We will ALL WIN in 2020 together!
"Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, 'I believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.' This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on 'super' late term abortion. Unforgivable!"
"Ed Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points!"
"Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long, straight putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly, Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack Tiger like each other."
"With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country, Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall, there is no Security. Human Trafficking, Drugs and Criminals of all dimensions KEEP OUT!"
"I am pleased to announce that David Bernhardt, Acting Secretary of the Interior, will be nominated as Secretary of the Interior. David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived, and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed!"
"Tremendous numbers of people are coming up through Mexico in the hopes of flooding our Southern Border. We have sent additional military. We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall, this would be a nonevent!"
"I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasn't seen it yet. He's just upset that he didn't win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren't given more credit for the Senate win by the media!"
"So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment."
".The Dems and their committees are going 'nuts.' The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!"
"Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans, far stronger action would be taken. Virginia will come back HOME Republican) in 2020!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!
So nice how well my State of the Union speech was received. Thank you to all!
"Working hard, thank you!"
"Deepest sympathies to Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the entire family of John Dingell. Longest serving Congressman in Country's history which, if people understand politics, means he was very smart. A great reputation and highly respected man."
"I was a big fan of Frank Robinson, both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed!"
"My representatives have just left North Korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second Summit with Kim Jong Un. It will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on February 27 28. I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim advancing the cause of peace!"
"North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he won't surprise me, because I have gotten to know him fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket an Economic one!"
It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING Thank you all!
The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!
"We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and don't let the Democrats sound bites fool you!"
"The Democrats just don't seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!"
"Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!"
"I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the socalled 'Carbon Footprint' to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas the Military even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!"
"Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?"
African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia!
Gallup Poll 'Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.' This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!
"I don't think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!"
"It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!"
"The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.."
".The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes too many Regulations, Border, Immigration HealthCare problems, much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!"
"The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don't even want to take muderers into custody! What's going on?"
"Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!"
No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)!
"The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!"
The Democrats are so self righteous and ANGRY! Loosen up and have some fun. The Country is doing well!
Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much else tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later!
?? ??? ????. ?? ??? ?????. ?? ??? ????. ???? ????? ??? ????
"Beautiful evening in El Paso, Texas last night. God Bless the USA!"
Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator Richard Shelby. Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources.
".Will be getting almost $23 BILLION for Border Security. Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!"
"I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security. Not an easy task, but the Wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our Country!"
The Senate Intelligence Committee THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA!
"The Gallup Poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year, a 16 year high. Nice!"
California has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. They owe the Federal Government three and a half billion dollars. We want that money back now. Whole project is a 'green' disaster!
Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a 'poor little Angel' when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal the Russia Hoax a puppet for Leakin' James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of 'insurance policy' in case I won.
".Many of the top FBI brass were fired, forced to leave, or left. McCabe's wife received BIG DOLLARS from Clinton people for her campaign he gave Hillary a pass. McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"After The Flight 93 Election, The Vote That Saved America And What We Still Have To Lose,' by very talented Michael Anton, is a terrific read. Check it out!"
"Great job by law enforcement in Aurora, Illinois. Heartfelt condolences to all of the victims and their families. America is with you!"
BUILDING THE WALL!
"Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at MaraLago giving the details. In the meantime, Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!"
"The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them.."
".The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!"
"Important meetings and calls on China Trade Deal, and more, today with my staff. Big progress being made on soooo many different fronts! Our Country has such fantastic potential for future growth and greatness on an even higher level!"
Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country's history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!
"52% Approval Rating, 93% in Republican Party ( a record )! Pretty amazing considering that 93% (also) of my press is REALLY BAD. The 'people' are SMART!"
"Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!"
THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
"These guys, the investigators, ought to be in jail. What they have done, working with the Obama intelligence agencies, is simply unprecedented. This is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this Country, and Mueller is a coverup.' Rush Limbaugh"
"The Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!"
"Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.."
".There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military, Vets, Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous 'insurance policy' in full action!"
"Hope you are enjoying your President's Day, our Country is making unprecedented progress!"
The people of Venezuela are standing for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY and the United States of America is standing right by their side!
"I ask every member of the Maduro regime End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free! Now is the time for all Venezuelan Patriots to act together, as one united people. Nothing could be better for the future of Venezuela!"
Today more than 50 countries around the world now recognize the rightful government of Venezuela. The Venezuelan people have spoken and the world has heard their voice. They are turning the page on Socialism and Dictatorship and there will be NO GOING BACK!
"Remember this, Andrew McCabe didn't go to the bathroom without the approval of Leakin' James Comey!"
"Had the opposition party (no, not the Media) won the election, the Stock Market would be down at least 10,000 points by now. We are heading up, up, up!"
"As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit! California, the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!"
"The failed Fast Train project in California, where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting, is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!"
"The Washington Post is a Fact Checker only for the Democrats. For the Republicans, and for your all time favorite President, it is a Fake Fact Checker!"
I never said anything bad about Andrew McCabe's wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI. I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)!
Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!
"The Press has never been more dishonest than it is today. Stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact. The writers don't even call asking for verification. They are totally out of control. Sadly, I kept many of them in business. In six years, they all go BUST!"
"If thinking that James Comey is not a good FBI Director is tantamount to being an agent of Russia, than just list all the people that are agents of Russia Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Rod Rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of Comey, the Inspector General.' Trey Gowdy"
The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
California now wants to scale back their already failed 'fast train' project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from L.A. to San Francisco. A different deal and record cost overruns. Send the Federal Government back the Billions of Dollars WASTED!
"I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!"
"I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on"
".something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology!"
"Senator John Cornyn has done an outstanding job for the people of Texas. He is strong on Crime, the Border, the Second Amendment and loves our Military and Vets. John has my complete and total endorsement. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, head of Senate Intelligence, said, after interviewing over 200 witnesses and studying over 2 million pages of documents, 'WE HAVE FOUND NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.' The Witch Hunt, so bad for our Country, must end!"
"I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations."
".Kelly has done an outstanding job representing our Nation and I have no doubt that, under her leadership, our Country will be represented at the highest level. Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family!"
God Bless the people of Venezuela!
"There is far more ENERGY on the Right than there is on the Left. That's why we just won the Senate and why we will win big in 2020. The Fake News just doesn't want to report the facts. Border Security is a big factor. The under construction Wall will stop Gangs, Drugs and Crime!"
"The people of Venezuela stand at the threshold of history, ready to reclaim their country and their future."
"There's not one shred of evidence that this president's done anything Constitutionally (or anything else) wrong.' Graham Ledger. Thank you Graham, so true!"
"HOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th. It will be called 'A Salute To America' and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!"
"Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade. Will continue today! I will be leaving for Hanoi, Vietnam, early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, where we both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore. Denuclearization?"
President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!
"Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!"
93% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 52% Approval Rating overall! Not bad considering I get the most unfair (BAD) press in the history of presidential politics! And don't forget the Witch Hunt!
"The only Collusion with the Russians was with Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National CommitteeAnd, where's the Server that the DNC refused to give to the FBI? Where are the new Texts between Agent Lisa Page and her Agent lover, Peter S? We want them now!"
"So funny to watch people who have failed for years, they got NOTHING, telling me how to negotiate with North Korea. But thanks anyway!"
"I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. As a result of these very"
".productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at MaraLago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. China!"
"We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol, our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job, but without the Wall, which is now under major construction, you cannot have Border Security. Drugs, Gangs and Human Trafficking must be stopped!"
"Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!"
"Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike fragile!"
"Meeting for breakfast with our Nation's Governors then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!"
"Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin' Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!"
"I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!"
Since my election as President the Dow Jones is up 43% and the NASDAQ Composite almost 50%. Great news for your 401(k)s as they continue to grow. We are bringing back America faster than anyone thought possible!
"It is my honor today to announce that Danny Burch, a United States citizen who has been held hostage in Yemen for 18 months, has been recovered and reunited with his wife and children. I appreciate the support of the United Arab Emirates in bringing Danny home"
"Danny's recovery reflects the best of what the United States its partners can accomplish. We work every day to bring Americans home. We maintain constant and intensive diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement cooperation within the United States Government and with"
"our foreign partners. Recovering American hostages is a priority of my Admin, and with Danny's release, we have now secured freedom for 20 American captives since my election victory. We will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home!"
China Trade Deal (and more) in advanced stages. Relationship between our two Countries is very strong. I have therefore agreed to delay U.S. tariff hikes. Let's see what happens?
Heading over to Vietnam for my meeting with Kim Jong Un. Looking forward to a very productive Summit!
"If a deal is made with China, our great American Farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before!"
Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies AFTER birth.
".This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it's protecting the lives of innocent babies."
"Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds, and so much love!"
"Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon Very Interesting!"
The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn't do 'it' during eight years of the Obama Administration?
"I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!"
"Fiat Chrysler will be adding more than 6,500 JOBS in Michigan (Detroit area), doubling its hourly workforce as part of a 4.5 Billion Dollar investment. Thank you Fiat Chrysler. They are all coming back to the USA, it's where the action is!"
"All false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse. I believe that China, Russia, Japan South Korea will be very helpful!"
Great meetings and dinner tonight in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Very good dialogue. Resuming tomorrow!
"THANK YOU to our generous hosts in Hanoi this week President Trong, Prime Minister Phuc, and the wonderful people of Vietnam!"
"Today in Alaska, it was my great honor to visit with our brave men and women of the United States Military at Joint Base ElmendorfRichardson. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. THANK YOU!"
"Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, let's see what happens!"
"Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen's new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!"
"and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it's time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!"
"Michael Cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton's lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?"
"I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible."
".for Otto's mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!"
"I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef, pork, etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions."
.and I did not increase their second traunch of Tariffs to 25% on March 1st. This is very important for our great farmers and me!
"Will be speaking at CPAC at 1130 this morning. Record crowd, live broadcast. Enjoy!"
"TeamCavuto It was a 3 day train ride to Vietnam, not 3 hours!"
The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it.
We've got NASA 'rocking' again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all!
"said was a total lie, but Fake Media won't show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal should never have been allowed to start And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success!"
"After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.."
"Look how they're acting now and how we act when we're in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn't find anythingthey took a Fake Dossier couldn't find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.' Congressman Mark Green, (RTN)."
"The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!"
"Presidential Harassment by 'crazed' Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure Yet the most successful first two years for any"
".President. We are WINNING big, the envy of the WORLD, but just think what it could be?"
"For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the 'walk.' Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!"
"To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!"
"The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those 'games', especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!"
Presidential Harassment!
"The American Media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct. Those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition, like the New Yorker or they've been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for"
Representative Ilhan Omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning Israel. Jewish groups have just sent a petition to Speaker Pelosi asking her to remove Omar from Foreign Relations Committee. A dark day for Israel!
"Now that they realize the only Collusion with Russia was done by Crooked Hillary Clinton the Democrats, Nadler, Schiff and the Dem heads of the Committees have gone stone cold CRAZY. 81 letter sent to innocent people to harass them. They won't get ANYTHING done for our Country!"
"The greatest overreach in the history of our Country. The Dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done. A big, fat, fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime, when in fact the real crime is what the Dems are doing, and have done!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Republican Approval Rating just hit 93%. Sorry Haters! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Scott Gottlieb, who has done an absolutely terrific job as Commissioner of the FDA, plans to leave government service sometime next month."
".Scott has helped us to lower drug prices, get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market, and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!"
"(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.' Awshucks, does that mean I won't get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!"
"Hans Von Spakovsky, 'I haven't seen any evidence of actual violations of the law, which is usually a basis before you start an investigation. Adam Schiff seems to be copying Joseph McCarthy in wanting to open up investigations when they don't have any evidence of wrongdoing."
"Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent, they are voting on desperately needed Border Security the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs, Human Traffickers, Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That's what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!"
It is shameful that House Democrats won't take a stronger stand against AntiSemitism in their conference. AntiSemitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it's inconceivable they will not act to condemn it!
"Congressman Chris Stewart 'No one is accusing the President of a crime and yet they (the Democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas. This is unprecedented.' They are desperately trying to find anything they can, even a punctuation mistake in a document!"
"Wall Street Journal 'More migrant families crossing into the U.S. illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year.' We are doing a great job at the border, but this is a National Emergency!"
"It was not a campaign contribution, and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. Fake News!"
We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board!
The Wall is being built and is well under construction. Big impact will be made. Many additional contracts are close to being signed. Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News!
"I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media. It is totally out of control, but we are winning!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House Senate Intelligence Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!
We are apprehending record numbers of illegal immigrants but we need the Wall to help our great Border Patrol Agents!
"Women's unemployment rate is down to 3.6% was 7.9% in January, 2011. Things are looking good!"
Heading now to the Great State of Alabama!
"Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!"
"Congratulations to Heather Wilson, who is the sole finalist to become the next President of University of Texas at El Paso effective September 1, 2019. Heather has done an absolutely fantastic job"
".as Secretary of the Air Force, and I know she will be equally great in the very important world of higher education. A strong thank you to Heather for her service."
"Aluminum prices are down 12% since I instituted Tariffs on Aluminum Dumping and the U.S. will be taking in Billions, plus jobs. Nice!"
"Border Patrol and Law Enforcement has apprehended (captured) large numbers of illegal immigrants at the Border. They won't be coming into the U.S. The Wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future, and now!"
"I hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the socalled Fast Train, which is $Billions over budget in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California!"
"More people are working today in the United States, 158,000,000, than at any time in our Country's history. That is a Big Deal!"
Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is O.K. with me!
"Republican Senators have a very easy vote this week. It is about Border Security and the Wall (stopping Crime, Drugs etc.), not Constitutionality and Precedent. It is an 80% positive issue. The Dems are 100% United, as usual, on a 20% issue, Open Borders and Crime. Get tough R's!"
"Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party. We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration, and it got worsts worse. There is antiSemitism in the Democratic Party. They don't care about Israel or the Jewish people.' Elizabeth Pipko, Jexodus."
"Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are."
".needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don't know about you, but I don't want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!"
"New York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!"
So many records being set with respect to our Economy. Unemployment numbers among BEST EVER. A beautiful thing to watch!
"I greatly appreciate Nancy Pelosi's statement against impeachment, but everyone must remember the minor fact that I never did anything wrong, the Economy and Unemployment are the best ever, Military and Vets are great and many other successes! How do you impeach."
".a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history, especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for 'high crimes and misdemeanors'?"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
"Defying voters, the Governor of California will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers. Friends and families of the always forgotten VICTIMS are not thrilled, and neither am I!"
"The just revealed FBI Agent Lisa Page transcripts make the Obama Justice Department look exactly like it was, a broken and corrupt machine. Hopefully, justice will finally be served. Much more to come!"
"The Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places. They are only getting more deranged with time!"
Democrats will have a unanimous vote on a 20% issue in opposing Republican Senators tomorrow. The Dems are for Open Borders and Crime!
Republican Senators are overthinking tomorrow's vote on National Emergency. It is very simply Border Security/No Crime Should not be thought of any other way. We have a MAJOR NATIONAL EMERGENCY at our Border and the People of our Country know it very well!
"A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto, if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare, but it can be easily fixed!"
My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!
"The Democrats are 'Border Deniers.' They refuse to see or acknowledge the Death, Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking at our Southern Border!"
Prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the National Emergency at the Southern Border and to protect the American people are both CONSTITUTIONAL and EXPRESSLY authorized by Congress.
".If, at a later date, Congress wants to update the law, I will support those efforts, but today's issue is BORDER SECURITY and Crime!!! Don't vote with Pelosi!"
"A vote for today's resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!"
VETO!
"I look forward to VETOING the just passed Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs, and Trafficking in our Country. I thank all of the Strong Republicans who voted to support Border Security and our desperately needed WALL!"
"My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!"
"So, if there was knowingly acknowledged to be 'zero' crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel."
.should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report. This was an illegal conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win..
..THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!
"I'd like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!"
"Just spoke with Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours. I informed the Prime Minister."
".that we stand in solidarity with New Zealand and that any assistance the U.S.A. can give, we stand by ready to help. We love you New Zealand!"
"On the recent nonbinding vote (4200) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn't matter. Play along with the game!"
This is a National Emergency
"Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier 'is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.' Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel. He had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!"
"Because the economy is so good, General Motors must get their Lordstown, Ohio, plant open, maybe in a different form or with a new owner, FAST! Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!"
"How is the Paris Environmental Accord working out for France? After 18 weeks of rioting by the Yellow Vest Protesters, I guess not so well! In the meantime, the United States has gone to the top of all lists on the Environment."
"It's truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over over, without so much of a mention of 'the other side.' Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows"
Report Christopher Steele backed up his Democrat Crooked Hillary paid for Fake Unverified Dossier with information he got from 'send in watchers' of low ratings CNN. This is the info that got us the Witch Hunt!
"So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) 'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!"
Happy St. Patrick's Day!
".must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have, don't give it to them. Be strong prosper, be weak die! Stay true."
"Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce. G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% Unemployment!"
"Those Republican Senators who voted in favor of Strong Border Security (and the Wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their States. They know there is a National Emergency at the Southern Border, and they had the courage to ACT. Great job!"
"Just spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union — I don't care, I just want it open!"
"What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the 'ballot box' and then, after that failed, with the 'Insurance Policy,' is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"General Motors and the UAW are going to start 'talks' in September/October. Why wait, start them now! I want jobs to stay in the U.S.A. and want Lordstown (Ohio), in one of the best economies in our history, opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast! Car companies.."
93% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President. Get used to it, another low I.Q. individual!"
The Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand. They will have to work very hard to prove that one. So Ridiculous!
GDP growth during the four quarters of 2018 was the fastest since 2005. This Administration is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office. GROWTH is beating MARKET EXPECTATIONS!
"While the press doesn't like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year, this to Homeland Security. If I didn't do it there would be hell to pay from the FAKE NEWS MEDIA!"
"The Fake News Media has NEVER been more Dishonest or Corrupt than it is right now. There has never been a time like this in American History. Very exciting but also, very sad! Fake News is the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!"
"Amazingly, CNN just released a poll at 71%, saying that the economy is in the best shape since 2001, 18 years! WOW, is CNN becoming a believer?"
"Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier different than campaigning for the Electoral College. It's like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to."
".just the large States the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States the entire Midwest would end up losing all power  we can't let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A."
"The Democrats are getting very 'strange.' They now want to change the voting age to 16, abolish the Electoral College, and Increase significantly the number of Supreme Court Justices. Actually, you've got to win it at the Ballot Box!"
"George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife's success angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER husband from hell!"
Really beautiful to see!
ISIS Caliphate two years ago in red vs. ISIS Caliphate TODAY. (Was even worse in November 2016 before I took office).
"After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!"
"3.1 GDP FOR THE YEAR, BEST NUMBER IN 14 YEARS!"
"ISIS uses the internet better than almost anyone, but for all of those susceptible to ISIS propaganda, they are now being beaten badly at every level."
".There is nothing to admire about them, they will always try to show a glimmer of vicious hope, but they are losers and barely breathing. Think about that before you destroy your lives and the lives of your family!"
It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!
"Good Morning, Have A Great Day!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
The Mainstream Media is under fire and being scorned all over the World as being corrupt and FAKE. For two years they pushed the Russian Collusion Delusion when they always knew there was No Collusion. They truly are the Enemy of the People and the Real Opposition Party!
The Republican Party will become 'The Party of Healthcare!
"Thank you to the House Republicans for sticking together and the BIG WIN today on the Border. Today's vote simply reaffirms Congressional Democrats are the party of Open Borders, Drugs and Crime!"
"Will be heading to Grand Rapids, Michigan, tonight for a Big Rally. Will be talking about the many exciting things that are happening to our Country, but also the car companies, others, that are pouring back into Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North South Carolina all over!"
"The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major 'breakdown,' have ZERO credibility or respect, must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday, I will tell you the secret!"
"Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don't care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!"
FBI DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!
"Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!"
"Wow, ratings for 'Morning Joe,' which were really bad in the first place, just 'tanked' with the release of the Mueller Report. Likewise, other shows on MSNBC and CNN have gone down by as much as 50%. Just shows, Fake News never wins!"
"Very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high. Thank you!"
"The Republican Party will become the Party of Great HealthCare! ObamaCare is a disaster, far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high virtually unusable! Moving forward in Courts and Legislatively!"
"We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration drugs!"
"On this Vietnam War Veterans Day, we celebrate the brave Vietnam Veterans and all of America's Veterans. Thank you for your service to our great Nation!"
This has been an incredible couple of weeks for AMERICA!
"The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S."
".through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING.."
".the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and 'talk.' Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!"
"Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, Stock Market, would have both been much higher World Markets would be in a better place!"
"Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the 'insurance policy' statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth.."
"The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass Complain Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, we've got a Country to run!"
"So funny that The New York Times The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!"
Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!
"The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING, a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice, but not for long!"
"Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released, most Democrats and others have gone back to the preWitch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exists!"
"Democrats, working with Republicans in Congress, can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!"
Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!
"No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!"
Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdue's disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!
"Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work. Premiums deductibles are far too high Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.."
.are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate win
".back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also, Republicans will always support PreExisting Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever is respected again!"
The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any 'place' in history. The people of Puerto Rico..
".are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas Florida combined, yet their government can't do anything right, the place is a mess nothing works. FEMA the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like.."
".the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!"
"Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, all their local politicians do is complain ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, only take from USA."
"Robert Mueller was a Godlike figure to the Democrats, until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30,000,000 Mueller Report. Now the Dems don't even acknowledge his name, have become totally unhinged, and would like to go through the whole process again. It won't happen!"
There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
"After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!"
"I haven't seen any Democrats down here at the Border working with us or asking to speak to any of us. They have an open invitation. We are getting overrun, our facilities are overcapacity. We are at an emergency crisis.' Art Del Cueto, National Border Patrol Council."
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better less expensive alternative to ObamaCare
"Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action, Border, or large sections of Border, will close. This is a National Emergency!"
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM!
"Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the Economy is looking very strong, the China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely, there is little or no Inflation, and USA optimism is very high!"
"According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started so illegal!"
There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!
"The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!"
WELCOME BACK JOE!
"The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop."
".However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn't work, which it will, I will close the Border."
".This will supersede USMCA. Likewise I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!"
Heading to the Southern Border to show a section of the new Wall being built! Leaving now!
Congratulations to Brian Hagedorn on his big surprise win over a well funded Liberal Democrat in the Great State of Wisconsin for a very important Supreme Court seat. Republicans are producing big for Wisconsin!
I've employed thousands of Electrical Workers. They will be voting for me!
"The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can't stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
"Will soon be landing in Calexico, California to look at a portion of the new WALL being built on our Southern Border. Within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction keeping our Country SAFE not easy when the Dems are always fighting to stop you!"
"Just arrived in Calexico, California!"
Just checked out the new Wall on the Border GREAT! Leaving now for L.A.
"So, let's get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back."
". against something I knew never existed, Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous!) No Obstruction. This Russia Hoax must never happen to another President, and Law Enforcement must find out, HOW DID IT START?"
Why should I be defending a fraudulent Russian Witch Hunt. It's about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the American People start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. How and why did this terrible event begin? Never Forget!
We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border's specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States. This will cause traffic commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use.
".it's powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry."
".In the meantime, the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws. Once that happens, all will be smooth. We can NEVER allow Open Borders!"
Pleased to report that the American tourist and tour guide that were abducted in Uganda have been released. God bless them and their families!
"Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service."
More apprehensions (captures) at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes No Open Borders (Crimes Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary
".Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!"
"The reason the whole process seems so politicized is that Democrats made up this complete lie about Collusion .and none of it happened.' Charles Hurt. The Russian Hoax never happened, it was a fraud on the American people!"
Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. Bring them to justice openly and quickly!
"The Democrats will never be satisfied, no matter what they get, how much they get, or how many pages they get. It will never end, but that's the way life goes!"
Congratulations to Virginia Great game!
"The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products! The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"
"Congressman Jerry Nadler fought me for years on a very large development I built on the West Side of Manhattan. He wanted a Rail Yard built underneath the development or even better, to stop the job. He didn't get either the development became VERY successful. Nevertheless,."
".I got along very well with Jerry during the zoning and building process. Then I changed course (slightly), became President, and now I am dealing with Congressman Nadler again. Some things never end, but hopefully it will all go well for everyone. Only time will tell!"
The Mainstream Media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today. It only seems to get worse. So much Fake News!
"She (Congresswoman Omar) keeps on assaulting Jews' Jeff Ballabon, B2 Strategic, CEO"
Check this out TRUTH!
"THANK YOU, WORKING HARD!"
The Democrats must end the loopholes on immigration. So easy to solve!
"Everybody is now acknowledging that, right from the time I announced my run for President, I was 100% correct on the Border. Remember the heat I took? Democrats should now get rid of the loopholes. The Border is being fixed. Mexico will not let people through!"
"THANK YOU Texas, I love you!"
I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS. Their Open Border mindset is putting our Country at risk. Will not let this happen!
"Too bad that the European Union is being so tough on the United Kingdom and Brexit. The E.U. is likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States, which will change. Sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you!"
SPY GAMES TIME FOR ANSWERS
Beautiful afternoon in the Oval Office today with a few great American HEROES!
"House Democrats want to negotiate a $2 TRILLION spending increase but can't even pass their own plan. We can't afford it anyway, and it's not happening!"
JOBLESS CLAIMS AT 50 YEAR LOW!
"Even the Democrats now say that our Southern Border is a Crisis and a National Emergency. Hopefully, we will not be getting any more BAD (outrageous) court decisions!"
"Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only."
".The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy so this should make them very happy!"
WE WILL NEVER FORGET!
"If the Radical Left Democrats all of a sudden don't want the Illegal Migrants in their Sanctuary Cities (no more open arms), why should others be expected to take them into their communities? Go home and come into our Country legally and through a system of Merit!"
"In New York State, Democrats blocked a Bill expanding College Tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. No wonder so many people are leaving N.Y. Very Sad!"
"I agree with Kim Jong Un of North Korea that our personal relationship remains very good, perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate, and that a third Summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand. North Korea has tremendous potential for."
".extraordinary growth, economic success and riches under the leadership of Chairman Kim. I look forward to the day, which could be soon, when Nuclear Weapons and Sanctions can be removed, and then watching North Korea become one of the most successful nations of the World!"
"Why should Radical Left Democrats in Congress have a right to retry and examine the $35,000,000 (two years in the making) No Collusion Mueller Report, when the crime committed was by Crooked Hillary, the DNC and Dirty Cops? Attorney General Barr will make the decision!"
"The New York Times Sanctuary Cities/Immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. They never call to check for truth. Their sources often don't even exist, a fraud. They will lie cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. In 6 years they will be gone.."
"I never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials, never ordered anyone to close our Southern Border (although I have the absolute right to do so, and may if Mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our Border), and am not 'frustrated.' It is all Fake Corrupt News!"
".So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently 'detained immigrants' after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule. If they don't want to serve our Nation by taking care of them, why should other cities towns?"
"Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not, Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants and this includes Gang Members, Drug Dealers, Human Traffickers, and Criminals of all shapes, sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!"
"Just out The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management high taxes!"
"If the Fed had done its job properly, which it has not, the Stock Market would have been up 5000 to 10,000 additional points, and GDP would have been well over 4% instead of 3%with almost no inflation. Quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!"
"What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, REBRAND the plane with a new name. No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?"
"Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction. These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!"
Congress should come back to D.C. now and FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!
"Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the antiSemitic, antiIsrael and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!"
THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN (We will never forget)!
The Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct!
"Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!"
".Since there was no Collusion, why was there an Investigation in the first place! Answer Dirty Cops, Dems and Crooked Hillary!"
Heading to the Great State of Minnesota!
So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!
"The forgotten voters of the 2016 Election are now doing great. The Steel Industry is rebuilding and expanding at a pace that it hasn't seen in decades. Our Country has one of the best Economies in many years, perhaps ever. Unemployment numbers best in 51 years. Wow!"
God bless the people of France!
No Collusion No Obstruction!
No Collusion No Obstruction!
I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!
"Democrats in Congress must return from their Vacations and change the Immigration Laws, or the Border, despite the great job being done by Border Patrol, will only get worse. Big sections of Wall now being built!"
"The Greatest Political Hoax of all time! Crimes were committed by Crooked, Dirty Cops and DNC/The Democrats."
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
No Collusion No Obstruction!
"As I have been saying all along, NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!"
"Anything the Russians did concerning the 2016 Election was done while Obama was President. He was told about it and did nothing! Most importantly, the vote was not affected."
"agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad). This was an Illegally Started Hoax that never should have happened, a"
".big, fat, waste of time, energy and money $30,000,000 to be exact. It is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason. This should never happen again!"
"Wishing a Happy Passover to all those celebrating in America, Israel, and around the world!"
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. The Russia Hoax is dead!
The end result of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history is No Collusion with Russia (and No Obstruction). Pretty Amazing!
"Happy Easter! I have never been happier or more content because your Country is doing so well, with an Economy that is the talk of the World and may be stronger than it has ever been before. Have a great day!"
"138 people have been killed in Sri Lanka, with more that 600 badly injured, in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels. The United States offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of Sri Lanka. We stand ready to help!"
"Do you believe this? The New York Times OpEd MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS OWE TRUMP AN APOLOGY. Well, they got that one right!"
"Despite No Collusion, No Obstruction, The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people, but only to Investigate and waste time. This is costing our Country greatly, and will cost the Dems big time in 2020!"
Jobless claims in the United States have reached their lowest (BEST) level in over 50 years!
Can you believe that I had to go through the worst and most corrupt political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States (No Collusion) when it was the 'other side' that illegally created the diversionary criminal event and even spied on my campaign? Disgraceful!
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can't impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!"
"My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board. I will respect his wishes. Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!"
Spoke to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka this morning to inform him that the United States stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism. Also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the People of the United States!
"Spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte, mostly concerning Immigration, Taxes, Trade, and the Economy of both of our countries. Very good call!"
"Isn't it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say 'NO COLLUSION' and only very good things!"
This should NEVER happen to another President AGAIN!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!"
"I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees beg for forgivenessthey are truly the Enemy of the People!"
"I will be going to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for a really big Rally on Saturday Evening. Big crowd expected, much to talk about. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"The Radical Left Democrats, together with their leaders in the Fake News Media, have gone totally insane! I guess that means that the Republican agenda is working. Stay tuned for more!"
"In the 'old days' if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, 'It's the economy stupid.' Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in historyand to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!"
".Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact, it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot, despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!"
"..But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn't playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD!"
The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
You mean the Stock Market hit an alltime record high today and they're actually talking impeachment!? Will I ever be given credit for anything by the Fake News Media or Radical Liberal Dems? NO COLLUSION!
"The American people deserve to know who is in this Country. Yesterday, the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question, a really big deal. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border call up the Military. The Coyotes Cartels have weapons!"
"Mexico's Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers, probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending returning!"
"..are there no 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors,' there are no Crimes by me at all. All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops and we caught them in the act! We waited for Mueller and WON, so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope!"
"Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418,000 plus illegal immigrants, way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!"
"No Collusion, No Obstruction there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent. Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems, plus I allowed everyone to testify, including W.H. counsel. I didn't have to do this, but now they want more.."

"The reason for the China pullback attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to 'negotiate' with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come."

Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S.
".The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods products, a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy.."
".agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!"
"Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!"
"Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute. This is not the Obama Administration, or the Administration of Sleepy Joe, who let China get away with 'murder!"
The average 401(k) balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market 466%. Wow!
".If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers, far more than China buys now, we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure, Healthcare, or anything else. China would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!"

"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations."

Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. It's very simple!
"I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didn't care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!"
"So now the Radical Left Dems don't talk about Collusion anymore, because the Mueller Report said there was No Collusion, they only want to talk about Obstruction, even though there was No Obstruction or No Crime except for the crimes committed by the other side!"
"I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky have a Democrat win in which case they would continue to ripoff the USA for $500 Billion a year."
".The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy employment numbers in U.S. history, much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!"
"The Democrats have nothing. Just want to distract from this President. The FBI was not doing its job, the State Department was covering things up everyday for Hillary. At the end of the day they're fearful of what they did, and should be fearful. This is a tough.."
"Think of it. I became President of the United States in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation. From long before I ever took office, I was under a sick unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the Russian."
".Hoax. My campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the Democrats. This never happened before in American history, and it all turned out to be a total scam, a Witch Hunt, that yielded No Collusion, No Obstruction. This must never be allowed to happen again!"
Big attacks on Republicans and Conservatives by Social Media. Not good!
"We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from nonTariffed countries"
"The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a 'Constitutional Crisis.' They and their partner, the Fake News Media, are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. They are a sad JOKE! We may have the strongest Economy in our history, best"
".employment numbers ever, low taxes regulations, a rebuilt military V.A., many great new judges, so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation, a Witch Hunt, a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis hopefully guilty people will pay!"
"Despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax, the biggest in American history!"
"Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion No Obstruction, the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies, and with NO REASON. That's all they want to do don't care about anything else!"
"When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course), it was supposed to be over, back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone 'nuts,' and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020, or little will get done!"
The 'Constitutional Crisis' is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.

"Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said, and says?"
"There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be.."
"completely avoided if you buy from a nonTariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That's Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"
"..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliatewill only get worse!"

"In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on 'dumped' steel from China other countries, and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries, both of which are coming back strong!"
"China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a nonTariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.."
".so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China, and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the 'piggy bank' that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!"
"We can make a deal with China tomorrow, before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business, but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.."
"Billions of Dollars, and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don't want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!"
"When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.."
".of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen, and much faster than people think!"
"Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy"
".This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been 'forgotten' for many years. Their time is now!"
"China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a 'match,' it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!"

"The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes crime, he's your man. NYC HATES HIM!"
"The Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that, if we work together, it can be immediately fixed. We need Democrat votes and all will be well!"
"Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border. The bad 'hombres,' of which there are many, are being detained will be sent home. Those which we release under the ridiculous Catch Telease loophole, are being registered and will be removed later!"
"All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed. Please do not make yourselves too comfortable, you will be leaving soon!"

".Conditions, drug prices down for first time in 51 years ( soon will drop much further), Right to Try, protecting your 2nd Amendment, big Tax Reg Cuts, 3.2 GDP, Strong Foreign Policy, much much more that nobody else would have been able to do. Our Country is doing GREAT!"
".he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and, ultimately, NO OBSTRUCTIONAnyway, how do you Obstruct when there is no crime and, in fact, the crimes were committed by the other side? Justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands!"
Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!
"With the wonderful College, University and other Graduations taking place all over the USA, there has never been a better time than now to graduate. Best jobs market ever, great housing and financing. Go out there, work hard, have a GREAT life. You deserve it. Congratulations!"
"Our Economy and Jobs Market is BOOMING, the best in the World and in our Country's history and we have just started!"

".who got them there. Chris Wallace said, 'I actually think, whether you like his opinions or not, that Mayor Pete has a lot of substancefascinating biography.' Gee, he never speaks well of me I like Mike Wallace betterand Alfred E. Newman will never be President!"
"The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn't need money. Very old"
".fashioned, but true. When you don't need or want money, you don't need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage, and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don't even exist)"
The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! That's why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax. But the American people are wise to what is going on..
"..was very good and highly professional to deal with and if for any reason I didn't like them, I would have gone elsewhere.there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money. Fake News!"
"Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler, Schiff, would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!"
"Looks like Bernie Sanders is history. Sleepy Joe Biden is pulling ahead and think about it, I'm only here because of Sleepy Joe and the man who took him off the 1% trash heap, President O! China wants Sleepy Joe BADLY!"
"On this Cuban Independence Day, we stand by the people of Cuba in their quest for freedom, democracy and prosperity. The Cuban regime must end its repression of Cubans Venezuelans. The United States will not stand idly by as Cuba continues to subvert democracy in the Americas!"
"The Fake News put out a typically false statement, without any knowledge that the United States was trying to set up a negotiation with Iran. This is a false report."
".Iran will call us if and when they are ever ready. In the meantime, their economy continues to collapse very sad for the Iranian people!"

"I am very disappointed that Mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our Southern Border where everyone knows that because of the Democrats, our Immigration Laws are totally flawed broken"
"Mexico's attitude is that people from other countries, including Mexico, should have the right to flow into the U.S. that U.S. taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated w/this illegal migration. Mexico is wrong and I will soon be giving a response!"
"Pennsylvania Don't forget to get out and VOTE TODAY for Republican Fred Keller for Congress. Fred is Strong on Crime, Second Amendment, Military, Vets, and Healthcare. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
".at a conclusion of NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION! The Dems were unhappy with the outcome of the $40M Mueller Report, so now they want a doover."
Shahira Knight has done a wonderful job as my Legislative Affairs Director at the White House. She was outstanding for us and for our Country will be a tremendous success in the private sector!
"After spending 40 Million Dollars, reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents, interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House, the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats, so they want a DO OVER. It doesn't work that wayso bad for our Country!"
"The Democrats are on a fishing expedition, wanting to interview the same people, and see the same things, as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems. Never happened to a president before. Never even happened to President Obama!"
"John Brennan on the Mueller probe, 'I don't know if I received bad information, but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.' Wow, he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc."
"Great news for Republicans Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE, over 70% of the vote. Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night. Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family!"
"After two years of an expensive and comprehensive Witch Hunt, the Democrats don't like the result and they want a DO OVER. In other words, the Witch Hunt continues!"
"The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong, the Witch Hunt!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt, my poll numbers, especially because of our historically 'great' economy, would be at 65%. Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History."
"Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is, the Haters say that is not a new Wall, but rather a renovation. Wrong, and we must build where most needed."
"Also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!"
"Everybody, including me, thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others), that was the end. But no, the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. Bad for the Country!"

"As I have long been saying, and has now been proven out, this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself, and it was the other side that caused the problem, not us!"
"So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America, or get back to work."
".But they really want a doover! You can't investigate and legislate simultaneously it just doesn't work that way. You can't go down two tracks at the same time. Let Chuck, Nancy, Jerry, Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games."
".In the meantime, my Administration is achieving things that have never been done before, including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Country's history."
".Democrat leadership is tearing the United States apart, but I will continue to set records for the American People and Nancy, thank you so much for your prayers, I know you truly mean it!"
Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No DoOvers!
Democrats don't want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They don't want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!
"The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress. All of their effort is about a ReDo of the Mueller Report, which didn't turn out the way they wanted. It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. Their heart is not into Infrastructure, lower.."
".drug prices, preexisting conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do, six committees, is squander time, day after day, trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before, it should never happen again!"
The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY!
"Rex Tillerson, a man who is 'dumb as a rock' and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State, made up a story (he got fired) that I was outprepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany. I don't think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!"
"I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, knowing that they would say I was raging, which they always do, along with their partner, the Fake News Media. Well, so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway Fake Corrupt Press!"
"When the Democrats in Congress refinish, for the 5th time, their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding, they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done. Move quickly!"
"The U.S. Senate has just approved a 19 Billion Dollar Disaster Relief Bill, with my total approval. Great!"
".during the 2016 Presidential election. The Attorney General has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation, in accordance with the longestablished standards for handling classified information."
PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE
"When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down, back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME!"
"I don't know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states, loud clear for all to hear, No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a DoOver!"
"Mitch McConnell and our Republican Senators have been very solid and strong. We have accomplished a great deal together, in particular with our Courts, 107 Federal Judges."
.(with many more to come) and 2 Supreme Court Justices we are getting into record territory! Thank you all and have a great Memorial Day Weekend.
"..The Dems want a second shot at Bob Mueller, are very unhappy with the No Collusion Report. They should not be allowed to play this game any longer no second chances must get back to work. So bad for our Country!"
"In Alaska with our GREAT TROOPS, departing shortly for Japan!"
Democrat Senator Mark Warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Their is nothing bipartisan about him. He should not be allowed to take 'command' of that Committee. Too important! Remember when he spoke to the Russian jokester?
"Can't believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington, D.C. They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help, I will!"
Getting ready to land in Japan with First Lady Melania. We look forward to seeing everyone soon!
"Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!"
"In addition to great incompetence and corruption, The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime. Remember, 'MAGA COUNTRY DID IT!' That turned out to be a total lie, had nothing to do with 'MAGA COUNTRY.' Serious stuff, and not even an apology to millions of people!"
"North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?"
Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!
"The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington, D.C. next year, hopefully for many years to come. It is where they want to be, where they should be. Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men women of the Pentagon for working it out!"
"Congratulations to the Great (and my friend) Roger Penske on winning his 18th (UNBELIEVABLE!) Indianapolis 500. I am in Japan, very early in the morning, but I got to watch Simon drive one of the greatest races in the history of the sport. I will see them both, TEAM, at the WH!"
The Dems are getting NOTHING done in Congress! They only want a DoOver on Mueller!
Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do!
".Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!"
"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!"
"I will be making two stops this morning in Japan to visit with our Great Military, then a quick stop in Alaska and back to D.C. Meetings with Prime Minister Abe went very well, and getting to spend time with the new Emperor and Empress of Japan was a great honor!"
GOD BLESS THE USA
Storms overnight across Ohio and many other States were very dangerous and damaging. My team continues to update me with reports from emergency managers in the States affected. Listen to your local officials and be resilient. We are with you!
"I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a 'low IQ idiot,' and many other things, whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer 'low IQ individual.' Who could possibly be upset with that?"
Back from Japan after a very successful trip. Big progress on MANY fronts. A great country with a wonderful leader in Prime Minister Abe!
THANK YOU JAPAN!
"Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama. This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn't, and probably won't.."
"If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our ProLife victories. Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating.Judges and Supreme Court Justices!"
"Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you."
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCHHUNT!
"The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history. After spending $40,000,000 over two dark years, with unlimited access, people, resources and cooperation, highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!"
"Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt HoaxAnd now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn't exist. So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media,.."
".say he fought back against this phony crime that didn't exist, this horrendous false accusation, and he shouldn't fight back, he should just sit back and take it. Could this be Obstruction? No, Mueller didn't find Obstruction either. Presidential Harassment!"
"Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI. He had already been in that position for 12 years, I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel A total Conflict of Interest. NICE!"
"Very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend, Senator Thad Cochran. He was a real Senator with incredible values even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important Healthcare Vote when he was desperately ill. Thad never let our Country (or me) down!"
Just arrived in Colorado. Getting ready to deliver the commencement speech at the Air Force Academy graduation. Very exciting probably will be broadcast live on TV. They want good ratings!
"Yesterday, Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever 1,036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am. Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border!"
"The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration, or even Fake News but why not, everything else is!"
"On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,.."
.at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.
"Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border, the Dems won't do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders, which equals crime!"
"Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"
"In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!"
"90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico our Southern Border. 80,000 people died last year, 1,000,000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It's time!"
"Saddened to hear about the loss of John Pinto, a Navajo Code Talker in World War II, over the Memorial Day Weekend. The Code Talkers are true American HEROES and John never stopped serving his fellow citizens as a longtime New Mexico State Senator. John, Rest In Peace!"
"As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals."

"Emmet Flood, who came to the White House to help me with the Mueller Report, will be leaving service on June 14th. He has done an outstanding job NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION! Case Closed! Emmet is my friend, and I thank him for the GREAT JOB he has done."
"Washington Post got it wrong, as usual. The U.S. is charging 25% against 250 Billion Dollars of goods shipped from China, not 200 BD. Also, China is paying a heavy cost in that they will subsidize goods to keep them coming, devalue their currency, yet companies are moving to.."
".U.S. in order to avoid paying the 25% Tariff. Like Mexican companies will move back to the United States once the Tariff reaches the higher levels. They took many of our companies jobs, the foolish Pols let it happen, and now they will come back unless Mexico stops the.."
"travesty that is taking place in allowing millions of people to easily meander through their country and INVADE the U.S., not to mention the Drugs Human Trafficking pouring in through Mexico. Are the Drug Lords, Cartels Coyotes really running Mexico? We will soon find out!"
"When you are the 'Piggy Bank' Nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years, the word TARIFF is a beautiful word indeed! Others must treat the United States fairly and with respect We are no longer the 'fools' of the past!"
The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes.
"People have been saying for years that we should talk to Mexico. The problem is that Mexico is an 'abuser' of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers."
".Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs). America has had enough!"
"The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!"
"NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, NO NOTHING! 'What the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.' David Rivkin, Constitutional Scholar. Meantime, the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress. They are frozen stiff. Get back to work, much to do!"
"Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is, they've been 'talking' for 25 years. We want action, not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise, our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!"
"Democrats can't impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are 'pouring' in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress, go back to work and help us at the Border, with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure."
"Hearing word that Russia, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria, and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose, what will it get you? STOP!"
"Kevin Hassett, who has done such a great job for me and the Administration, will be leaving shortly. His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S. I want to thank Kevin for all he has done he is a true friend!"

"China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking Billions!"
"London part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country. Haven't seen any protests yet, but I'm sure the."
".Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also, big Trade Deal is possible once U.K. gets rid of the shackles. Already starting to talk!"
Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela.
"As a sign of good faith, Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border. They can do it if they want!"
Just had a big victory in Federal Court over the Democrats in the House on the desperately needed Border Wall. A big step in the right direction. Wall is under construction!
"Can you imagine Cryin' Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!"
"Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You can't win without people!"
"I kept hearing that there would be 'massive' rallies against me in the UK, but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me. They were big enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops!"
"House Democrats, fresh off a Republican victory against them (in Federal Court) on the Wall, keep asking people to come and testify regarding the No Collusion Witch Hunt. They are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, especially with his corrective letter, now want a Do Over!"
"If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt, I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe Best Ever! If the Corrupt Media was actually fair, I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the Fake News, we're doing great!"
"Immigration discussions at the White House with representatives of Mexico have ended for the day. Progress is being made, but not nearly enough! Border arrests for May are at 133,000 because of Mexico the Democrats in Congress refusing to budge on immigration reform. Further"
".talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that, if no agreement is reached, Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday, with monthly increases as per schedule. The higher the Tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!"
A big and beautiful day today!
So sorry to hear about the terrible accident involving our GREAT West Point Cadets. We mourn the loss of life and pray for the injured. God Bless them ALL!
"China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking in Billions!"
"Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement, especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress."
and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me both illegal unprecedented in U.S. history. There was no Collusion Investigate the Investigators! Go to work on Drug Price Reductions Infrastructure!
"If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!"
Democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid Immigration Bill!
"For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!"

"Brandon Judd, National Border Patrol Council 'That's going to be a huge deal because Mexico will be using their strong Immigration Laws A game changer. People no longer will be released into the U.S.' Also, 6000 Mexican Troops at their Southern Border. Currently there are few!"
"Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!"
MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!
"Nervous Nancy Pelosi the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers Unions!"
Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!
"I would like to thank the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico, for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!"
"Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. Fake News! No wonder their ratings, along with CNN, are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing!"
".other than to know he was, and is, a total Loser. When he makes statements about me, they are made up, he knows nothing!"
"..Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn't have, and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done. Importantly, some things.."
"..not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico the USA, something that didn't exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason"
"Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform, without restriction. It's called Freedom of Speech, remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!"
"If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me, despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done, no credit!"
"Now with our new deal, Mexico is doing more for the USA on Illegal Immigration than the Democrats. In fact, the Democrats are doing NOTHING, they want Open Borders, which means Illigal Immigration, Drugs and Crime."
"We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico's Legislative body!.."
".We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!"
"When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported 'hit job' on me, something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick Journalism"
"Can't believe they are bringing in John Dean, the disgraced Nixon White House Counsel who is a paid CNN contributor. No Collusion No Obstruction! Democrats just want a doover which they'll never get!"
"Despite the Phony Witch Hunt, we will continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you!!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"The United States has VERY LOW INFLATION, a beautiful thing!"
"Maria, Dagan, Steve, Stuart V When you are the big 'piggy bank' that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed), Tariffs are a great negotiating tool, a great revenue producers and, most importantly, a powerful way to get"
"Companies to come to the U.S.A and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. We stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to Mexico. If the Tariffs went on at the higher level, they would all come back, and pass. But very happy with the deal I made,"
".If Mexico produces (which I think they will). Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed! China is similar, except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariff. So far, little effect to consumer. Companies will relocate to U.S."
Good day in the Stock Market. People have no idea the tremendous potential our Country has for GROWTH and many other things!
"On my way to Iowa just heard nearly 1,000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging Congress to approve the USMCA. Our Patriot Farmers rural America have spoken! Now Congress must do its job support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan USMCA Trade Agreement!"
"Beautiful afternoon in Iowa. Thank you to all of our Nation's Farmers. May God bless you, and may God Bless America!"
"..The Fake (Corrupt) News Media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which, by the way and despite the phony and never ending Witch Hunt, are the best numbers WE have ever had. They reported Fake numbers that they made up don't even exist. WE WILL WIN AGAIN!"
"Wow! Just got word that our June 18th, Tuesday, ANNOUNCEMENT in Orlando, Florida, already has 74,000 requests for a 20,000 seat Arena. With all of the big events that we have done, this ticket looks to be the 'hottest' of them all. See you in Florida!"
"The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. Their new weapon of choice is Fake Polling, sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016, but this is worse.."

"I meet and talk to 'foreign governments' every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about 'Everything!' Should I immediately."
".call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again. With that being said, my full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media. They purposely leave out the part that matters."
".and other really bad people, SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN! They even had an 'insurance policy' just in case Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost their race for the Presidency! This is the biggest worst political scandal in the history of the United States of America. Sad!"
They've been wrong all along!
"While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!"

All in for Senator Steve Daines as he proposes an Amendment for a strong BAN on burning our American Flag. A no brainer!
The Corrupt News Media is totally out of control they have given up and don't even care anymore. Mainstream Media has ZERO CREDIBILITY TOTAL LOSERS!
".misleading in that I personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews. I do have a few other things to do, you know!). Think I will do many more Network Interviews, as I did in 2016, in order to get the word out that no President has done what I have in"
"..the first 2 1/2 years of his Presidency, including the fact that we have one of the best Economies in the history of our Country. It is called Earned Media. In any event, enjoy the show!"
"Do you believe that the Failing New York Times just did a story stating that the United States is substantially increasing Cyber Attacks on Russia. This is a virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story, any story, even if bad for our Country.."
"..ALSO, NOT TRUE! Anything goes with our Corrupt News Media today. They will do, or say, whatever it takes, with not even the slightest thought of consequence! These are true cowards and without doubt, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"

"When will the Fake News Media start asking Democrats if they are OK with the hiring of Christopher Steele, a foreign agent, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, to dig up 'dirt' and write a phony Dossier against the Presidential Candidate of the opposing party"
"If Republicans ever did that to the Democrats, there would be all hell to pay. It would be a scandal like no other!"
Almost 70% in new Poll say don't impeach. So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They can't win the election fairly!

".long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a SafeThird Agreement. The only ones who won't do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes, and fix asylum! If so, Border Crisis will end quickly!"

"Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others."
European Markets rose on comments (unfair to U.S.) made today by Mario D!
"The Fake News doesn't report it, but Republican enthusiasm is at an all time high. Look what is going on in Orlando, Florida, right now! People have never seen anything like it (unless you play a guitar). Going to be wild See you later!"

"The Dems are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, so after almost 3 years, they want a Redo, or Do Over. This is extreme Presidential Harassment. They gave Crooked Hillary's people complete Immunity, yet now they bring back Hope Hicks. Why aren't the Dems looking at the.."
".33,000 Emails that Hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS? That is real Obstruction that the Dems want no part of because their hearings are RIGGED and a disgrace to our Country!"
"If I didn't have the Phony Witch Hunt going on for 3 years, and if the Fake News Media and their partner in Crime, the Democrats, would have played it straight, I would be way up in the Polls right now with our Economy, winning by 20 points. But I'm winning anyway!"
"So sad that the Democrats are putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell, for 3 years now, after total exoneration by Robert Mueller the Mueller Report. They were unhappy with result so they want a Do Over. Very unfair costly to her. Will it ever end? Why aren't they."
".asking Hillary Clinton why she deleted and acid washed her Emails AFTER getting a subpoena from Congress? Anybody else would be in jail for that, yet the Dems refuse to even bring it up. Rigged House Committee"
"Just returning from Orlando and Doral (Miami), Florida, and heading to the Oval Office, where I will present the great Economist, Dr. Arthur Laffer, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom."

SP opens at Record High!
Iran made a very big mistake!
"Just revealed that the Failing and Desperate New York Times was feeding false stories about me, those associated with me, to the FBI. This shows the kind of unprecedented hatred I have been putting up with for years with this Crooked newspaper. Is what they have done legal?"
"President Obama made a desperate and terrible deal with Iran Gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH! Iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. Gave them a free path to Nuclear Weapons, and SOON. Instead of saying thank you, Iran yelled.."
".Death to America. I terminated deal, which was not even ratified by Congress, and imposed strong sanctions. They are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my Presidency, when they were causing major problems throughout the Middle East. Now they are Bust!."
".On Monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in International Waters. We were cocked loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not."
".proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!"
"The people that Ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported. This means that they have run from the law and run from the courts. These are people that are supposed to go back to their home country. They broke the law by coming into the country, now by staying."
"When people come into our Country illegally, they will be DEPORTED!"
Thank you Jessica!
"I am at Camp David working on many things, including Iran! We have a great Economy, Tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge Dollars coming IN, on helping to make good Trade Deals. The Dow heading to BEST June in 80 years! Stock Market BEST June in 50 years!"
"Iran cannot have Nuclear Weapons! Under the terrible Obama plan, they would have been on their way to Nuclear in a short number of years, and existing verification is not acceptable. We are putting major additional Sanctions on Iran on Monday. I look forward to the day that.."
".Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again The sooner the better!"
"At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!"
"I never called the strike against Iran 'BACK,' as people are incorrectly reporting, I just stopped it from going forward at this time!"
"I want to give the Democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to Asylum and Loopholes. This will fix the Southern Border, together with the help that Mexico is now giving us. Probably won't happen, but worth a try. Two weeks and big Deportation begins!"
Wonderful Church service at Camp David. Thank you!
"When our Country had no debt and built everything from Highways to the Military with CASH, we had a big system of Tariffs. Now we allow other countries to steal our wealth, treasure, and jobs But no more! The USA is doing great, with unlimited upside into the future!"
"China gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight, Japan 62%, many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been."
.a dangerous journey. We don't even need to be there in that the U.S. has just become (by far) the largest producer of Energy anywhere in the world! The U.S. request for Iran is very simple No Nuclear Weapons and No Further Sponsoring of Terror!
"Despite a Federal Reserve that doesn't know what it is doing raised rates far too fast (very low inflation, other parts of world slowing, lowering easing) did large scale tightening, $50 Billion/month, we are on course to have one of the best Months of June in US history"
".Think of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right. Thousands of points higher on the Dow, and GDP in the 4's or even 5's. Now they stick, like a stubborn child, when we need rates cuts, easing, to make up for what other countries are doing against us. Blew it!"
Stock Market is heading for one of the best months (June) in the history of our Country. Thank you Mr. President!
"Iran leadership doesn't understand the words 'nice' or 'compassion,' they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone.."
".The wonderful Iranian people are suffering, and for no reason at all. Their leadership spends all of its money on Terror, and little on anything else. The U.S. has not forgotten Iran's use of IED's EFP's (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more"
".Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry Obama!"
"A brave former fighter jet pilot and warrior, Senator Martha McSally of Arizona has done an outstanding job in D.C., and is fully supportive of our agenda she is with us all the way."
".Martha is strong on Crime and Borders, the 2nd Amendment, and loves our Military and Vets. She has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
"Staff Sgt. David Bellavia today, we honor your extraordinary courage, we salute your selfless service, and we thank you for carrying on the legacy of American Valor that has always made our blessed nation the strongest and mightiest in the world!"
"Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has really stepped up to the plate. Thom is tough on Crime, Strong on the Border and fights hard against Illegal Immigration. He loves our Military, our Vets and our great Second Amendment. I give Thom my Full and Total Endorsement!"
Presidential Harassment!
"Too bad the Dems in Congress won't do anything at all about Border Security. They want Open Borders, which means crime. But we are getting it done, including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good, the best in history."
"Democrats want Open Borders, which equals violent crime, drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes, like 90%. Republicans want what's good for America the exact opposite!"
".in our Country's history, and the poverty index is also best number EVER), leagues and teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women's Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job! We haven't yet."
".invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!"
"The Democrats should change the Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives will be saved at our Southern Border. They said it was not a crisis at the Border, that it was all just 'manufactured.' Now they admit that I was right But they must do something about it. Fix the Laws NOW!"
The Democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very DANGEROUS Immigration Laws. It can be done instantly!
".No Collusion, No Obstruction! Robert Mueller said he was done after his last 9 minute news conference, as later corrected. Now the Dems want to give it another try. Does it ever end?"
"The Republican Senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our Southern Border, 848! In addition to aid, Congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the Crisis. We must end incentives for Smuggling Children, Trafficking Women, and Selling Drugs."
"Why aren't the Democrats in the House calling Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Page and her FBI lover (whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted), Crooked Hillary, Podesta, Ohr (and Nellie), the GPS Fusion characters, Christopher Steele, the DNC ( their missing server)."
".and all of the others who have leaked, lied and did so many other terrible things? How is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward? Because it is a Rigged Democrat Con Game, and the Fake and Corrupt Media loves every minute of it!"
These flyers depict Australia's policy on Illegal Immigration. Much can be learned!
BORING!
Just stopped in Alaska and said hello to our GREAT troops!
"I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India, for years having put very high Tariffs against the United States, just recently increased the Tariffs even further. This is unacceptable and the Tariffs must be withdrawn!"
"Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020. I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the.."
"..United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great Country, we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a Citizen. Only in America!"
Bipartisan Humanitarian Aid Bill for the Southern Border just passed. A great job done by all! Now we must work to get rid of the Loopholes and fix Asylum. Thank you also to Mexico for the work being done on helping with Illegal Immigration a very big difference!
All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That's the end of that race!
"The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won a Big Crash!"
"I am in Japan at the G20, representing our Country well, but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted, the other is nuts so what's the big deal?"
"54% in Poll! I would be at 75% (with our great economy, maybe the best ever) if not for the Phony Witch Hunt and the Fake News Media!"
"After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!"
"I had a great meeting with President Xi of China yesterday, far better than expected. I agreed not to increase the already existing Tariffs that we charge China while we continue to negotiate. China has agreed that, during the negotiation, they will begin purchasing large.."
".amounts of agricultural product from our great Farmers. At the request of our High Tech companies, and President Xi, I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our National Security. Importantly, we have opened up negotiations"
".again with China as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one. The quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. I am in no hurry, but things look very good! There will be no reduction in the Tariffs currently being charged to China."
"I am in South Korea now. President Moon and I have 'toasted' our new Trade Deal, a far better one for us than that which it replaced. Today I will visit with, and speak to, our Troops and also go to the the DMZ (long planned). My meeting with President Moon went very well!"
"The highly respected Farm Journal has just announced my Approval Rating with our great Farmers at 74%, and that despite all of the Fake Corrupt News that they are forced to endure. Farmers have been unfairly treated for many years and that is turning around FAST!"
"The leaders of virtually every country that I met at the G20 congratulated me on our great economy. Many countries are having difficulties on that score. We have the best economy anywhere in the world, with GREAT UNLIMITED potential looking into the future!"
"Leaving South Korea after a wonderful meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Stood on the soil of North Korea, an important statement for all, and a great honor!"
"So many amazing things happened over the last three days. All, or at least most of those things, are great for the United States. Much was accomplished!"
"Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state. Many were planning to leave, will now be staying. New York others should start changing their thought process on taxes, fast!"
"Thank you to President Moon of South Korea for hosting the American Delegation and me immediately following the very successful G20 in Japan. While there, it was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting. Good things can happen for all!"
Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run G20. There wasn't a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made. PERFECT! The people of Japan must be very proud of their Prime Minister.
"In my opinion the President has done more good on the Korean issue in the last year and a half than President Obama did in eight years. If you look at the strides they made during the Obama years, which advocated strategic patiencethey stuck their head in the sand. This is.."
"It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything, always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent expenses gave away"
".more money than it had. Going on for years, originally brought by Crooked Hillary's Campaign Chair, A.G. Eric Schneiderman, until forced to resign for abuse against women. They never even looked at the disgusting Clinton Foundation. Now Cuomo's A.G. is harassing all of my."
".New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible. So, on top of ridiculously high taxes, my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!"
"It was great being with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea this weekend. We had a great meeting, he looked really well and very healthy I look forward to seeing him again soon."
".In the meantime, our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. No rush, but I am sure we will ultimately get there!"
"People are fleeing New York like never before. If they own a business, they are twice as likely to flee. And if they are a victim of harassment by the A.G. of the state, like what they are doing to our great NRA, which I think will move quickly to Texas, where they are loved.."
"Texas will defend them indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo. So many people are leaving New York for Texas and Florida that it is totally under siege. First New York taxes you too high, then they sue you, just to complete the job"
"Mark Levin has written a big number one bestselling book called, conspicuously and accurately, 'Unfreedom of the Press.' It is a great book that tells it like it is, fake news and all. Keep this book number one!"
"As most people are aware, according to the Polls, I won EVERY debate, including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that in the first debate, they modulated the sound on me, and got caught. This crew looks somewhat easier than Crooked, but you never know?"
The Economy is the BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN! Even much of the Fake News is giving me credit for that!
"Big 4th of July in D.C. 'Salute to America.' The Pentagon our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers biggest ever Fireworks!"

Thanks to 'Phantom Fireworks' and 'Fireworks by Grucci' for their generosity in donating the biggest fireworks show Washington D.C. has ever seen. CEO's Bruce Zoldan and Phil Grucci are helping to make this the greatest 4th of July celebration in our Nations history!

"Iran was violating the 150 Billion Dollar (plus 1.8 Billion Dollar in CASH) Nuclear Deal with the United States, and others who paid NOTHING, long before I became President and they have now breached their stockpile limit. Not good!"
Our July 4th Salute to America at the Lincoln Memorial is looking to be really big. It will be the show of a lifetime!
We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world. Not bad!
SP 500 hits new record high. Up 19% for the year. Congratulations!
"China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games as they have for many years!"
"The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!"
"Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!"
"The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question."
"Our Border Patrol people are not hospital workers, doctors or nurses. The Democrats bad Immigration Laws, which could be easily fixed, are the problem. Great job by Border Patrol, above and beyond. Many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they.."
"..came from, and in far safer conditions. No matter how good things actually look, even if perfect, the Democrat visitors will act shocked aghast at how terrible things are. Just Pols. If they really want to fix them, change the Immigration Laws and Loopholes. So easy to do!"
"..Now, if you really want to fix the Crisis at the Southern Border, both humanitarian and otherwise, tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally, and hopefully through a system based on Merit. This way we have no problems at all!"
"If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers, just tell them not to come. All problems solved!"
Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the Border. Thank you Mexico!
"Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to 'any amount we want' if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!"
Today's Stock Market is the highest in the history of our great Country! This is the 104th time since the Election of 2016 that we have reached a NEW HIGH. Congratulations USA!
"So important for our Country that the very simple and basic 'Are you a Citizen of the United States?' question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July!"
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!
"People are coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history of our Country, SALUTE TO AMERICA, an all day event at the Lincoln Memorial, culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern.."
".and advanced aircraft anywhere in the World. Perhaps even Air Force One will do a low loud sprint over the crowd. That will start at 600P.M., but be there early. Then, at 900 P.M., a great (to put it mildly) fireworks display. I will speak on behalf of our great Country!"
"Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest most disloyal men in Congress is 'quitting' the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn't get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!"
Looks like a lot of people already heading to SALUTE TO AMERICA at Lincoln Memorial. It will be well worth the trip and wait. See you there at 600 P.M. Amazing music and bands. Thank you ARMY!

"My deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert Chris Cline, his wonderful daughter, Kameron, and their friends, on the tragic accident which took place in the Bahamas. The great people of West Virginia will never forget them!"
"Strong jobs report, low inflation, and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States, knowing that our Federal Reserve doesn't have a clue! They raised rates too soon, too often, tightened, while others did just the opposite."
".As well as we are doing from the day after the great Election, when the Market shot right up, it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created, used very well. Our most difficult problem is not our competitors, it is the Federal Reserve!"
"Joe Biden is a reclamation project. Some things are just not salvageable. China and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him. He deserted our military, our law enforcement and our healthcare. Added more debt than all other Presidents combined. Won't win!"
"Sleepy Joe Biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately, has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone's taxes if he becomes president. Ridiculously, all Democrats want to substantially raise taxes!"
"Last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down, but things have been, and are being, put in place that will drive them down substantially. If Dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion, we would get big results very fast!"
Congratulations to the U.S. Women's Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all!
".United States Citizens first. Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job. We said there was a Crisis the Fake News the Dems said it was 'manufactured.' Now all agree we were right, but they always knew that. They are crowded (which we.."
".brought up, not them) because the Dems won't change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!"
"We are building the Wall now, but the reason the badly needed Wall wasn't approved in the Republican controlled House and Senate was that we had a very slim majority in the Senate, needed 9 Democrat votes. They were totally unwilling to give Wall votes to us, want Open Borders!"
"Brilliant Constitutional Lawyer, Dr. John Eastman, said the Special Prosecutor (Mueller) should have NEVER been appointed in the first place. The entire exercise was fundamentally illegal. The Witch Hunt should never happen to another President of the U.S. again. A TOTAL SCAM!"
"I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way. I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well."
".thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him. The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister. While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!"
"Very good numbers on the economy. Much potential for growth. Trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation. We have been treated very unfairly (to put it mildly) by other countries for many years, but that is changing!"
"The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy. He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was"
".and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger..Thank you, Mr. President!"
India has long had a field day putting Tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable!
"Recent 'strained' decisions by the United States Supreme Court, some so simple as allowing the question, 'Are you a citizen of the United States' on our very expensive Census Report, or the even more strained decisions (2) allowing the world's most expensive pathetic"
".healthcare (Obamacare) to stay in place, when it would have been replaced by something far better, shows how incredibly important our upcoming 2020 Election is. I have long heard that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices is a President's most important decision. SO TRUE!"
"Democrats are coming after our great Kentucky Senator, Mitch McConnell, with someone who compared my election to September 11th."
".Why would Kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in Congress, the Senate Majority Leader, for a freshman Senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party. We need Mitch in the Senate to Keep America Great!!"
"A truly great, patriotic charitable man, Bernie Marcus, the cofounder of Home Depot who, at the age of 90, is coming under attack by the Radical Left Democrats with one of their often used weapons. They don't want people to shop at those GREAT stores because he contributed."
".to your favorite President, me! These people are vicious and totally crazed, but remember, there are far more great people ('Deplorables') in this country, than bad. Do to them what they do to you. Fight for Bernie Marcus and Home Depot!"
"More and more the Radical Left is using Commerce to hurt their 'Enemy.' They put out the name of a store, brand or company, and ask their socalled followers not to do business there. They don't care who gets hurt, but also don't understand that two can play that game!"
So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won't let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?
"Iran has long been secretly 'enriching,' in total violation of the terrible 150 Billion Dollar deal made by John Kerry and the Obama Administration. Remember, that deal was to expire in a short number of years. Sanctions will soon be increased, substantially!"
"Word just out that I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt. Unanimous decision in my favor from The United States Court of Appeals For The Fourth Circuit on the ridiculous Emoluments Case. I don't make money, but lose a fortune for the honor of.."

Thank you Robert Johnson!
"I was just informed by Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin, of her decision to keep the Sikorsky Helicopter Plant in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, open and humming! We are very proud of Pennsylvania and the people who work there."
".Thank you to Lockheed Martin, one of the USA's truly great companies!"
"The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today. Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion, we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship."
"The Pledge of Allegiance to our great Country, in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, is under siege. That is why I am going to win the Great State of Minnesota in the 2020 Election. People are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful USA!"
"Robert Johnson, B.E.T. 'I give the President a lot of credit for moving the Economy in a positive direction that's benefiting a large number of Americans. I think the Tax Cuts clearly helped stimulate the Economy. Overall, if you look at the U.S. Economy, and you look at.."
".the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth, you've got to give the President an A Plus for that.' Thank you Robert, one of our great business leaders!"
"The Fake News Media loves the narrative that I didn't use many banks because the banks didn't like me. No, I didn't use many banks because I didn't (don't) need their money (old fashioned, isn't it?). If I did, it would have been very easy for me to get."
".And remember, a bank that I did use years ago, the now badly written about and maligned Deutsche Bank, was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world! They wanted my business, and so did many others!"
"Now the Democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with Robert Mueller, and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing. How many bites at the apple do they get before working on Border Loopholes and Asylum. They also want to interview the highly"
".conflicted and compromised Mueller again. He said he was 'done' after his last 9 minute speech, and that he had nothing more to say outside of the No Collusion, No Obstruction, Report. Enough already, go back to work! I won, unanimously, the big Emoluments case yesterday!"
Will be a big and exciting day at the White House for Social Media!

So happy that I was able to keep Sikorsky Helicopter in the Great State of Pennsylvania. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
"A big subject today at the White House Social Media Summit will be the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer. The Fake News Media will also be there, but for a limited period.."
"The Fake News is not as important, or as powerful, as Social Media. They have lost tremendous credibility since that day in November, 2016, that I came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future First Lady. When I ultimately leave office in six"
"years, or maybe 10 or 14 (just kidding), they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility, or approval, from the public. That's why they will all be Endorsing me at some point, one way or the other. Could you imagine having Sleepy Joe Biden, or Alfred E. Newman"
"or a very nervous and skinny version of Pocahontas (1/1024th), as your President, rather than what you have now, so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius! Sorry to say that even Social Media would be driven out of business along with, and finally, the Fake News Media!"
"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity."
".Similarly, Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National"
"and International. We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!"
"Paul Ryan, the failed V.P. candidate former Speaker of the House, whose record of achievement was atrocious (except during my first two years as President), ultimately became a long running lame duck failure, leaving his Party in the lurch both as a fundraiser leader"
".When Mitt chose Paul I told people that's the end of that Presidential run. He quit Congress because he didn't know how to Win. They gave me standing O's in the Great State of Wisconsin, booed him off the stage. He promised me the Wall, failed (happening anyway!)"
.He had the Majority blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing. Never knew how to go after the Dems like they go after us. Couldn't get him out of Congress fast enough!
"SebGorka Wins Big, No Contest!"
"When you are the big 'piggy bank' that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed), Tariffs are a great negotiating tool, a great revenue producer and, most importantly, a powerful way to get"
".companies to come to the USA and to get companies that have left us for other lands to COME BACK HOME. We stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to Mexico. If the Tariffs went on at the higher level, they would all come back, and fast. But very happy with the deal I made,"
"..if Mexico produces (which I think they will). Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed! China is similar, except they devalue currency subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariffs. So far, little effect to consumers. Companies will relocate to U.S."
"Alex Acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than 12 years ago was bad for the Administration, which he so strongly believes in, and he graciously tendered his resignation."

MUELLER'S PARTISAN WITCH HUNT!
"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is a far superior leader than was Lame Duck Speaker Paul Ryan. Tougher, smarter and a far better fundraiser, Kevin is already closing in on 44 Million Dollars. Paul's final year numbers were, according to Breitbart, 'abysmal.' People like.."
".Paul Ryan almost killed the Republican Party. Weak, ineffective stupid are not exactly the qualities that Republicans, or the CITIZENS of our Country, were looking for. Right now our spirit is at an all time high, far better than the Radical Left Dems. You'll see next year!"
"94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, an all time high. Ronald Reagan was 87%. Thank you!"

"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly"
".and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how."
".it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"
"..Sorry, can't let them into our Country. If too crowded, tell them not to come to USA, and tell the Dems to fix the Loopholes Problem Solved!"
"So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion. Whenever confronted, they call their adversaries, including Nancy Pelosi, 'RACIST.' Their disgusting language.."
".and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged. If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!"
"We are doing great Economically as a Country, Number One, despite the Fed's antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow!"
China's 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for nontariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal.
".with the U.S., and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place. In the meantime, we are receiving Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China, with possibly much more to come. These Tariffs are paid for by China devaluing pumping, not by the U.S. taxpayer!"
"When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them their horrible disgusting actions!"
"If Democrats want to unite around the foul language racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S."
"We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of Communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own Country, they're calling the guards along our Border (the Border Patrol Agents) Concentration Camp Guards, they accuse people who support Israel as doing it for the Benjamin's,."
".they are AntiSemitic, they are AntiAmerica, we don't need to know anything about them personally, talk about their policies. I think they are American citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting, that the American people will reject"
".What does it mean for America to have free Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants, no criminalization of coming into our Country See how that works for controlling Immigration! They talk about Israel like they're a bunch of thugs, not victims of the entire region. They wanted"
"We will never be a Socialist or Communist Country. IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE, YOU CAN LEAVE! It is your choice, and your choice alone. This is about love for America. Certain people HATE our Country."
".They are antiIsrael, pro AlQaeda, and comment on the 9/11 attack, 'some people did something.' Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders, which means drugs, crime, human trafficking, and much more."
".Detention facilities are not Concentration Camps! America has never been stronger than it is now rebuilt Military, highest Stock Market EVER, lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before. Keep America Great!"
"The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four 'progressives,' but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"The Democrat Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party. Horrible antiIsrael, antiUSA, proterrorist public.."
"..shouting of the Fword, among many other terrible things, and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!"
"Our Country is Free, Beautiful and Very Successful. If you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave!"
"Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don't have a Racist bone in my body! The socalled vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show 'weakness' and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat.."
"..Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020!"
"So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today's vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen. If you really want to see statements, look at the horrible things they said about our Country, Israel, and much more. They are now the top, most"
".visible members of the House Democrats, who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate. The Republican vote was 1874. Wow! Also, this was the first time since 1984 that the Speaker of the House was ruled Out of Order and broke the Rules of the House. Quite a day!"
"In America, if you hate our Country, you are free to leave. The simple fact of the matter is, the four Congresswomen think that America is wicked in its origins, they think that America is even more wicked now, that we are all racist and evil. They're entitled to their.."
"opinion, they're Americans. Now I'm entitled to my opinion, I just think they're left wing cranks. They're the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle, we should ignore them. The 'squad' has moved the Democrat Party substantially LEFT, and.."

"Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve, we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words, our interest costs are much higher than other countries, when they should be lower. Correct!"
"I like New York Fed President John Williams first statement much better than his second. His first statement is 100% correct in that the Fed 'raised' far too fast too early. Also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening. We are in a World competition, winning big,"
".but it is no thanks to the Federal Reserve. Had they not acted so fast and 'so much,' we would be doing even better than we are doing right now. This is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the U.S., GROWTH, which would greatly reduce % debt. Don't blow it!"

"I don't believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!"
".Most importantly you have led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy, freedom, and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!"
"Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby, he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured."
".Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer, he must have seen how dangerous bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a 'manufactured crisis,' as the Fake News Media their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!"
"With almost no inflation, our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition, Quantitative Tightening is continuing, making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.."

Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
"Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report, NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!"

"So why didn't the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers!"

"Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA"
".As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous filthy place"
Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!
"Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only nonfighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS13 others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!"
"The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is, he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!"
"The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance, and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick disgusting and bad for our Country are they. What they are doing is so wrong, but they do it anyway. Dems have become the do nothing Party!"
"Democrats don't care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders, which means CRIME,CRIME,CRIME!"
"NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, TOTAL EXONERATION. DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT!"
".Robert Mueller's testimony, and the Mueller Report itself, was a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt. It is an embarrassment to the USA that they don't know how to stop. They can't help themselves, they are totally lost, they are Clowns!"
"So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically, Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry, but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!"
"Someone please explain to Nancy Pelosi, who was recently called racist by those in her own party, that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that Congressman Elijah Cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore. Just take"
".a look, the facts speak far louder than words! The Democrats always play the Race Card, when in fact they have done so little for our Nation's great African American people. Now, lowest unemployment in U.S. history, and only getting better. Elijah Cummings has failed badly!"
"Speaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!"
"There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!"
"If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical 'oversight' is a joke!"
"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves. Dan Coats, the current Director, will."
.be leaving office on August 15th. I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our Country. The Acting Director will be named shortly.
"Law Enforcement is at the scene of shootings in Gilroy, California. Reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended. Be careful and safe!"
"Baltimore, under the leadership of Elijah Cummings, has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation. 25 years of all talk, no action! So tired of listening to the same old BullNext, Reverend Al will show up to complain protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!"
"If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left 'Squad' and King Elijah's Baltimore Fail, it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!"
"Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say, 'it's a personal favor to me.' Seldom, but sometimes, I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!"
"The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems, making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime, and with very low inflation, our Fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!"
"Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement, I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist, just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is, Baltimore can be brought back, maybe"
".even to new heights of success and glory, but not with King Elijah and that crew. When the leaders of Baltimore want to see the City rise again, I am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call!"
"The Fed 'raised' way too early and way too much. Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well, the potential wealth creation that was missed, especially when measured against our debt, is staggering. We are competing with other.."
".countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That's actually why the E.U. was formed.and for China, until now, the U.S. has been 'easy pickens.' The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough, but we will win anyway!"
Looking forward to my meeting at 200 P.M. with wonderful Inner City Pastors!
".He is tough on Crime, Strong on Borders, and will fight for our Second Amendment. Daniel will never let you down. He has my Full and Complete Endorsement!"
"Just remember, the Iranians never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"
"Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who, despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum, make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help, Border getting strong!"
"Baltimore's numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years, but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!"
"Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe Open Borders refusing to change the Loopholes Asylum, tremendous progress is being made the the Southern Border. We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible Immigration Laws.They didn't!"
"China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just don't come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years."
"..My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal, like in past 30 years, and continue"
"to ripoff the USA, even bigger and better than ever before. The problem with them waiting, however, is that if when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating nowor no deal at all. We have all the cards, our past leaders never got it!"
"Wow! Morning Joe Psycho ratings have really crashed. Very small audience. People are tired of hearing Fake News delivered with an anger that is not to be believed. Sad, when the show was sane, they helped get me elected. Thanks! Was on all the time. Lost all of its juice!"
"Senate is working hard on America's Transportation Infrastructure Act. Will have BIG IMPACT on our highways and roads all across our Nation. Interest strong from Republicans and Democrats. Do I hear the beautiful word, BIPARTISAN? Get it done. I am with you!"
"Just reminded my staff that Morning Joe Psycho were with me in my room, at their request, the night I won New Hampshire. Likewise, followed me to other states."
".Don't watch show, but heard Mika said I asked to preside over their marriage. Not true—does anyone really believe that? They were married by Elijah, King of Baltimore!"
"Heading to Jamestown, Virginia. Word is the Democrats will make it as uncomfortable as possible, but that's ok because today is not about them!"
Great reception in Jamestown by both REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS. Respect for our Country's incredible Heritage. Thank you!
"Wow! A federal Judge in the Southern District of N.Y. completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee against our historic 2016 campaign for President. The Judge said the DNC case was 'entirely divorced' from the facts, yet another total complete."
".vindication exoneration from the Russian, WikiLeaks and every other form of HOAX perpetrated by the DNC, Radical Democrats and others. This is really big 'stuff' especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by President Clinton. The Witch Hunt Ends!"
"Such a great victory in court yesterday on the Russian Hoax, the greatest political scam in the history of our Country. TREASON! Hopefully, the Attorney Generel of the United States, and all of those working with him, will find out, in great detail, what happened. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
"If I hadn't won the 2016 Election, we would be in a Great Recession/Depression right now. The people I saw on stage last night, you can add in Sleepy Joe, Harris, the rest, will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before. With me, only up!"
The lesser of two Socialists is still a Socialist!' Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana
"CNN's Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television, insinuated last night while asking a debate 'question' that I was a racist, when in fact I am 'the least racist person in the world.' Perhaps someone should explain to Don that he is supposed to be neutral, unbiased fair,.."
.or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. No wonder CNN's ratings (MSNBC's also) have gone down the tubes and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. Don't hold your breath!
"The Prosecutors who lost the case against SEAL Eddie Gallagher (who I released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly), were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal. Not only did they lose the case, they had difficulty with respect."
.to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion. I have directed the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards.
.I am very happy for Eddie Gallagher and his family!
"What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive ratecutting cycle which would keep pace with China, The European Union and other countries around the world."
".As usual, Powell let us down, but at least he is ending quantitative tightening, which shouldn't have started in the first place no inflation. We are winning anyway, but I am certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve!"
The Radical Left Dems went after me for using the words 'druginfested' concerning Baltimore. Take a look at Elijah C.
"The people on the stage tonight, and last, were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great! Our Country now is breaking records in almost every category, from Stock Market to Military to Unemployment. We have prosperity success like never before.."
"It will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success, or let it go. We are respected again all around the world. Keep it that way! I said I will never let you down, and I haven't. We will only grow bigger, better and stronger TOGETHER!"
"Budget Deal is phenomenal for our Great Military, our Vets, and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! Two year deal gets us past the Election. Go for it Republicans, there is always plenty of time to CUT!"
"BIG RALLY tonight in Cincinnati, Ohio. See you there! P.S. Our Country is doing GREAT!"
"Our representatives have just returned from China where they had constructive talks having to do with a future Trade Deal. We thought we had a deal with China three months ago, but sadly, China decided to renegotiate the deal prior to signing. More recently, China agreed to"
"buy agricultural product from the U.S. in large quantities, but did not do so. Additionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of Fentanyl to the United States this never happened, and many Americans continue to die! Trade talks are continuing, and"
"during the talks the U.S. will start, on September 1st, putting a small additional Tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country. This does not include the 250 Billion Dollars already Tariffed at 25%"
"We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!"
Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!
"Kim Jong Un and North Korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days. These missiles tests are not a violation of our signed Singapore agreement, nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands. There may be a United Nations violation, but.."
"..Chairman Kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust, there is far too much for North Korea to gain the potential as a Country, under Kim Jong Un's leadership, is unlimited. Also, there is far too much to lose. I may be wrong, but I believe that"
"A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!"
"Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media. Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people."
".John has therefore decided to stay in Congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of Texas, and our Country. I will be announcing my nomination for DNI shortly."
"Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals, not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They don't want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S."
"Things are going along very well with China. They are paying us Tens of Billions of Dollars, made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. So far our consumer is paying nothing and no inflation. No help from Fed!"
"Terrible shootings in ElPaso, Texas. Reports are very bad, many killed. Working with State and Local authorities, and Law Enforcement. Spoke to Governor to pledge total support of Federal Government. God be with you all!"
"Today's shooting in El Paso, Texas, was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today's hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people."
.Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas.
"The FBI, local and state law enforcement are working together in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already be learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day!"
"God bless the people of El Paso, Texas. God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio."
"Today, I authorized the lowering of the flags to halfstaff at all Federal Government buildings in honor of the victims of the tragedies in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio."
".The flags at the White House will be lowered today through Thursday, August 8. Melania and I are praying for all those impacted by this unspeakable act of evil!"
"We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them, and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying."
".this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!"
"The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!"
China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!
"Based on the historic currency manipulation by China, it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs they are being paid for compliments of China, and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars! China has always."
".used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workers' wages and harm our farmers' prices. Not anymore!"
"China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So onesided, it should have been stopped many years ago!"
"The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side FOREVER!"
"Today, I am also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the DEATH PENALTY and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay."
"We must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as ONE PEOPLE. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real, bipartisan solutions that will truly make America safer and better for all."
"Massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States for reasons of safety, investment, and interest rates! We are in a very strong position. Companies are also coming to the U.S. in big numbers. A beautiful thing to watch!"
"As they have learned in the last two years, our great American Farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them in that their President has stood with them and done what no other president would do And I'll do it again next year if necessary!"
"Will be going to Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas, tomorrow to meet with First Responders, Law Enforcement, and some of the victims of the terrible shootings."
"Beto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary, should respect the victims law enforcement  be quiet!"
Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States. South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the United States of America. The relationship between the two countries is a very good one!
"Three more Central Banks cut rates.' Our problem is not China We are stronger than ever, money is pouring into the U.S. while China is losing companies by the thousands to other countries, and their currency is under siege Our problem is a Federal Reserve that is too.."
".proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!). They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW. Yield curve is at too wide a margin, and no inflation! Incompetence is a.."
".terrible thing to watch, especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily. We will WIN anyway, but it would be much easier if the Fed understood, which they don't, that we are competing against other countries, all of whom want to do well at our expense!"
"Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech. Sooo Boring! The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy. It will be over for them, not to mention the fact that our Country will do poorly with him. It will be one big crash, but at least China will be happy!"
"Just left Dayton, Ohio, where I met with the Victims families, Law Enforcement, Medical Staff First Responders. It was a warm wonderful visit. Tremendous enthusiasm even Love. Then I saw failed Presidential Candidate (0%) Sherrod Brown Mayor Whaley totally.."
.misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital. Their news conference after I left for El Paso was a fraud. It bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that I was so lucky to meet and spend time with. They were all amazing!o
"We love you Dayton, Ohio!"
The people I met today in Dayton are the finest anywhere!
"I don't know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Joaquin is not the man that his brother is, but his brother, according to most, is not much. Keep fighting Joaquin!"
"Leaving El Paso for the White House. What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton, Ohio. The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips, but it just didn't work. The love, respect enthusiasm were there for all to see. They have been through so much. Sad!"
"The Dems new weapon is actually their old weapon, one which they never cease to use when they are down, or run out of facts, RACISM! They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi. I will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!"
"Incredible afternoon in El Paso, Texas. We love you, and are with you, all the way!"
My time spent in Dayton and El Paso with some of the greatest people on earth. Thank you for a job well done!
"As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not! The Fed's high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing,.."
".John Deere, our car companies, others, to compete on a level playing field. With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening, the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition. We have the greatest companies"
".in the world, there is nobody even close, but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our Federal Reserve. They have called it wrong at every step of the way, and we are still winning. Can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right?"
"Iran is in serious financial trouble. They want desperately to talk to the U.S., but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us, including President Macron of France."
".I know Emmanuel means well, as do all others, but nobody speaks for the United States but the United States itself. No one is authorized in any way, shape, or form, to represent us!"
"Sue Gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career. I have gotten to know Sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her. Sue has announced she will be leaving on August 15, which."
.coincides with the retirement of Dan Coats. A new Acting Director of National Intelligence will be named shortly.
"I am pleased to inform you that the Honorable Joseph Maguire, current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, will be named Acting Director of National Intelligence, effective August 15th. Admiral Maguire has a long and distinguished."
".career in the military, retiring from the U.S. Navy in 2010. He commanded at every level, including the Naval Special Warfare Command. He has also served as a National Security Fellow at Harvard University. I have no doubt he will do a great job!"
"Rod Blagojevich, the former Governor of Illinois, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He has served 7 years. Many people have asked that I study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one. White House staff is continuing the review of this matter."
"Serious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership on meaningful Background Checks. I have also been speaking to the NRA, and others, so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected. Guns should not be placed in the hands of.."
".mentally ill or deranged people. I am the biggest Second Amendment person there is, but we all must work together for the good and safety of our Country. Common sense things can be done that are good for everyone!"
"Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level, and with great Anger and Hate! They like to call themselves 'Elite,' but they are not Elite. In fact, it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the Elite. The movie coming out is made in order."
".to inflame and cause chaos. They create their own violence, and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists, and are very bad for our Country!"
"In a letter to me sent by Kim Jong Un, he stated, very nicely, that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over. It was a long letter, much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises. It was.."
".also a small apology for testing the short range missiles, and that this testing would stop when the exercises end. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future! A nuclear free North Korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world!"
"Never has the press been more inaccurate, unfair or corrupt! We are not fighting the Democrats, they are easy, we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media. They have gone totally CRAZY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Got to see, by accident, wacko comedian Bill Maher's show So many lies. He said patients in El Paso hospital didn't want to meet with me. Wrong! Had really great meetings with numerous patients. Said I was on vacation. Wrong! Long planned fix up of W.H., stay here rather than.."
".cause big disruption by going to Manhattan. Working almost all of the time, including evenings. Don't have to be in W.H. to do thatAnd sooo many other false statements. He is right about one thing, though. I will win again in 2020. Otherwise, he pays 95% in taxes!"
"China wants to make a deal so badly. Thousands of companies are leaving because of the Tariffs, they must stem the flow. At the same time China may be hoping for a Democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of America, the theft of hundreds of Billions of $'s!"
"Think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show, to so many, how totally dishonest the Fake News Media really is. It may be the most corrupt and disgusting business (almost) there is! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Joe Biden just said, 'We believe in facts, not truth.' Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are 'playing' in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn't have a clue!"
"..other than the fact that this Administration has probably done more than any other Administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence. Anthony, who would do anything to come back in, should remember the only reason he is on TV, and it's not for being the Mooch!"
"..TV talent. Then, during the 2016 Election, I would watch as Joe Scarborough his very angry Psycho wife(?) would push Donny to the point of total humiliation. He would never fight back because he wanted to stay on TV, even on a very low rated show, all in the name of ambition!"
"Many incredible things are happening right now for our Country. After years of being ripped off by other nations on both Trade Deals and the Military, things are changing fast. Big progress is being made. America is respected again. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
"Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn't want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"
"The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!"
"Through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system, the tens of billions of dollars that the U.S. is receiving is a gift from China. Prices not up, no inflation. Farmers getting more than China would be spending. Fake News won't report!"
Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldn't be allowed to have any weapon. He's nuts!
"As usual, China said they were going to be buying 'big' from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!"
"ALL THE NEWS THAT'S NOT FIT TO PRINT! 'The New York Times is no longer the paper we grew up with. It is no longer a news organization. It is now an agenda driven organization out to change the Country (for the worse!).' Michael Goodwin, Highly Respected New York Post Columnist."
"Many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can't imagine why?"
Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!
Just landed in Pennsylvania. Looking forward to making a speech on energy. So important!
"It always happens! When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting, raving, cursing, they get destroyed by the Fake News. But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it, Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!"
"No debate on Election Security should go forward without first agreeing that Voter ID (Identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement. Without Voter ID, it is all so meaningless!"
"Great day in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today, with the amazing energy workers, construction workers, and craft workers who make America run and who make America PROUD. No one in the world does it better than YOU!"
Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!
"We are winning, big time, against China. Companies jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up, and in some cases, have come down. China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much too fast. Now too slow to cut."
"..Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!"
"Good things were stated on the call with China the other day. They are eating the Tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and 'pouring' money into their system. The American consumer is fine with or without the September date, but much good will come from the short.."
"..deferral to December. It actually helps China more than us, but will be reciprocated. Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other nonTariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"
"I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a 'tough business.' I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?"
"Go out and get Andrew McCarthy's new book, 'Ball of Collusion.' 'Supervision became the investigator, and when they pushed the envelope, there was nobody there to tell them NO. It goes right to the President (Obama). Plenty of information that Obama was informed knew exactly"
"The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture, and after wounding so many police. Long sentence must get much tougher on street crime!"
"It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel all Jewish people, there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!"
"The United States is now, by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World, it is not even close! As others falter, we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever, plenty of cash. Business Optimism is at an All Time High!"
Our Great Farmers know how important it is to win on Trade. They will be the big winners!
"Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud, Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit, but this time a big one!"
"Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!"
"The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my reelection. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!"
"If they don't get this Trade Deal with the U.S. done, China could have it first recession (or worse!) in years. There's disinvestment in China right now. Also, the Fed is too tight (I agree).' Steve Moore, Heritage Foundation"
"Walmart, a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing, just released outstanding numbers. Our Country, unlike others, is doing great! Don't let the Fake News convince you otherwise."
Thank you to my good friend Chuck Canterbury for 16 years of service to the Fraternal Order of Police and our great men and women in blue. You are an incredible patriot!
Congratulations to Patrick Yoes for his election as National President of the great Fraternal Order of Police. Together we will fight for our incredible Law Enforcement Officers!
"Senator Jim Risch of the Great State of Idaho has been an incredible supporter of our Agenda! He is tough on Crime, Strong on Borders, and will continue to fight for our Second Amendment. Jim will never let you down. He has my Full and Complete Endorsement!"
"Israel was very respectful nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her 'grandmother.' As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!"
"Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib's grandmother. She doesn't have to see her now!"
"Like it or not, Tlaib and Omar are fast becoming the face of the Democrat Party. Cortez (AOC) is fuming, not happy about this!"
"Just completed a very good meeting on Afghanistan. Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal if possible!"
Having dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. They will be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!
"Great time in New Hampshire last night. Placed was maxed out, totally packed, with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. Thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. Energy was really great to see. We will win New Hampshire in 2020!"
"Look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in New Hampshire last night. Sorry we couldn't get you in, will be back soon!"
Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.' Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!
"The Failing New York Times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report his testimony were a total disaster), to a Racism Witch Hunt.."
"With all that this Administration has accomplished, think what my Poll Numbers would be if we had an honest Media, which we do not!"
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"We are doing very well with China, and talking!"
"Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!"
House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!
"The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office, hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune, even now, especially after their massive unfunded liability. I'm fairly certain they'll endorse me just to keep it all going!"
"Great cohesion inside the Republican Party, the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News, my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we've had so far! Think what they'd be if I got fair media coverage!"
"Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable 'nut job' who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetencemade a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,"
".got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, 'something big' was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn't want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy!"
"Democrats want Open Borders and Crime! So dangerous for our Country. But we are building a big, beautiful, NEW Wall! I will protect America, the Dems don't know where to start!"
"Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to 'will' the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world"
"..The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhancedgood for everyone!"
Massive overflow crowds in New Hampshire last week. Couldn't get into packed SNHU Arena. Fake and Corrupt News would like you to believe otherwise. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Spoke to my two good friends, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, regarding Trade, Strategic Partnerships and, most importantly, for India and Pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation, but good conversations!"
I promise not to do this to Greenland!
Nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me. He only lasted 11 days!
"Sorry, I don't buy Rep. Tlaib's tears. I have watched her violence, craziness and, most importantly, WORDS, for far too long. Now tears? She hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an antiSemite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!"
"Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time."
.The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!
".like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of GodBut American Jews don't know him or like him. They don't even know what they're doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that's OK, if he keeps doing what he's doing, he's good for.."
"Brandon Judd, President, National Border Patrol Council. 'This will effectively end Catch and Release and curb illegal entries."
Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota won't stand for this).
"The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the 'create' a U.S. recession, even though the numbers facts are working totally in the opposite direction. They would be willing to hurt many people, but that doesn't matter to them. Our Economy is sooo strong, sorry!"
"Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He's like a golfer who can't putt, has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing, BIG CUT but don't count on him! So far he has called it wrong, and only let us down."
"..We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. Yesterday, 'highest Dollar in U.S.History.' No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential, almost like never before!"
"My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!"
"So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.."
.WHERE IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE?
"For the record, Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending. They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet, only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much, much higher level than that."
".Because of me, these countries have agreed to pay ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided. Sorry!"
"The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, are 'rolling over' at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!"
"Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modernday descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn't work as well, because execs don't want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know."
".that when this Administration's alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers!"
"It was my honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25K of our most severely disabled Veterans. With today's order, we express the everlasting love loyalty of a truly grateful Nation. God bless our Vets, God Bless America!"
"Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar, No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!"
"The Economy is doing really well. The Federal Reserve can easily make it Record Setting! The question is being asked, why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early (for a change), not late. Let America win big, rather than just win!"
Just heard that Sean Spicer will be on 'Dancing with the Stars.' He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!
"Just concluded a very good meeting on preventing Mass Shootings. Talks are ongoing w/ both Republicans Democrats. We are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners, survivors, grieving family members, law enforcement, the NRA, mental health professionals, and school officials"
"I am hopeful Congress will engage with my Team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and, most importantly, Save Lives!"
"Looking forward to soon being in North Carolina to hold a big rally for wonderful Dan Bishop, who is running for Congress. His opponent wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities, and Socialism. He likes the 'Squad' more than North Carolina. Dan has my Full and Complete Endorsement!"
Congratulations to the GREAT Bob Cousy!
94% Approval Rating within the Republican Party. Thank you!
"The Economy is strong and good, whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well. Despite this the Fake News Media, together with their Partner, the Democrat Party, are working overtime to convince people that we are in, or will soon be going into, a Recession. They are.."
"..willing to lose their wealth, or a big part of it, just for the possibility of winning the Election. But it won't work because I always find a way to win, especially for the people! The greatest political movement in the history of our Country will have another big win in 2020!"
Now the Fed can show their stuff!
"As usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can 'speak' without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work 'brilliantly' with both, and the U.S. will do great"
".My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?"
"Our Country has lost, stupidly, Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year, they want to continue. I won't let that happen! We don't need China and, frankly, would be far."
".better off without them. The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing.."
".your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China's Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States. Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR REFUSE,."
".all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop it didn't. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!"
"The Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton, whoever that may be, has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!"
"For many years China (and many other countries) has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade, Intellectual Property Theft, and much more. Our Country has been losing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year to China, with no end in sight."
".Sadly, past Administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of Fair and Balanced Trade that it has become a great burden to the American Taxpayer. As President, I can no longer allow this to happen! In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very."
"unfair Trading Relationship. China should not have put new Tariffs on 75 BILLION DOLLARS of United States product (politically motivated!). Starting on October 1st, the 250 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, currently being taxed at 25%, will be taxed at 30%"
"Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10%, will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"
"For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!"
"When I looked up to the sky and jokingly said 'I am the chosen one,' at a press conference two days ago, referring to taking on Trade with China, little did I realize that the media would claim that I had a 'Messiah complex.' They knew I was kidding, being sarcastic, and just."
".having fun. I was smiling as I looked up and around. The MANY reporters with me were smiling also. They knew the TRUTHAnd yet when I saw the reporting, CNN, MSNBC and other Fake News outlets covered it as serious news me thinking of myself as the Messiah. No more trust!"
"Face It, You Probably Got A Tax Cut!' This was a New York Times headline, and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House, and keep the Senate and Presidency, one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!"
North Carolina Governor Cooper Vetoed a Bill that would have required Sheriffs to cooperate with Ice. This is a terrible decision for the great people of North Carolina. He should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!
Our great Economy is the talk of everyone!
The Media is destroying the Free Press! Mark Levin. So True!
"Before I arrived in France, the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G7 are very tense, and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster. Just like they are trying to force a Recession, they are trying to 'will' America into.."
".bad Economic times, the worse the better, anything to make my Election more difficult to win. Well, we are having very good meetings, the Leaders are getting along very well, and our Country, economically, is doing great the talk of the world!"
Such False and Inaccurate reporting thus far on the G7. The Fake News knows this but they can't help themselves! Leaving now to have breakfast with Boris J.
"Happy Birthday Regis, a truly special man!"
"Big Trade Deal just agreed to with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Will be great for our Farmers, Ranchers and more. Really big Corn purchase!"
"The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, 'Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?"
"In France we are all laughing at how knowingly inaccurate the U.S. reporting of events and conversations at the G7 is. These Leaders, and many others, are getting a major case study of Fake News at it's finest! They've got it all wrong, from Iran, to China Tariffs, to Boris!"
"My Stock Market gains must be judged from the day after the Election, November 9, 2016, where the Market went up big after the win, and because of the win. Had my opponent won, CRASH!"
"Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G7, only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous, never happened!"
"Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G7. Loves his Country greatly works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!"
"No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!"
The G7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!
"Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for 'anywhere."
The Federal Reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. Has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old USA? Our Fed has been calling it wrong for too long!
"The G7 in France was so successful, and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News, and watched numerous networks, it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!"
It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!
"They do stories so big on Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren's crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!"
"Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE, let's see, what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said, 'why don't we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it!' The media in our Country is totally out of control!"
"Can you believe it? I'm at 94% approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me. One is 'Mr. Appalachian Trail' who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons."
".Another is a onetime BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide, then failed in radio. The third is a man who couldn't stand up straight while receiving an award. I should be able to take them!"
"So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China, from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably In fact, they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!"
"We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!"
"Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, to seek a noconfidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson, especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, will prove to be 'a great one!' Love U.K."
"Our Federal Reserve cannot 'mentally' keep up with the competition other countries. At the G7 in France, all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually 'getting paid' to borrow money ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!"
"Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!."
".And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!"
"Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage FAKE NEWS!"
Thank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"A sad day for the Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I'm glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!"
"Puerto Rico is in great shape with Hurricane Dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated. Thank you to FEMA, first responders, and all, for working so hard being so well prepared. A great result! The bad news, Florida get ready! Storm is building and will be BIG!"
"Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night. Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions, it will be a very big Hurricane, perhaps one of the biggest!"
"Crazy Lawrence O'Donnell, who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency, even being previously forced by NBC to apologize, which he did while crying, for things he said about me The Apprentice, was again forced to apologize, this time.."
".for the most ridiculous claim of all, that Russia, Russia, Russia, or Russian oligarchs, cosigned loan documents for me, a guarantee. Totally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!"
"The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O'Donnell, for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize, is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible, corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!"
"The Economy is doing GREAT, with tremendous upside potential! If the Fed would do what they should, we are a Rocket upward!"
"The Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol, not even including the E15, year around, which is already done. It will be a giant package, get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all!"
Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report. He should be ashamed of himself!
"General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?"
"The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows, in the strongest of terms, how unfairly I, and tens of millions of great people who support me, were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back?"
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!
"The Euro is dropping against the Dollar 'like crazy,' giving them a big export and manufacturing advantageand the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesn't it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S."
".We don't have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players), we have a Fed problem. They don't have a clue!"
"If the Fed would cut, we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad managementand who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!"
The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.
FALLOUT FROM IG'S SCATHING COMEY REPORT
This should NEVER happen to another President again!
"The Great State of North Carolina has EARLY VOTING for a very important Congressional (Ninth) race. Please vote early (now), or on Election Day, September 10th, for Dan Bishop, a great guy. His opponent wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities is weak on Crime, Military Vets!"
Just arrived at Camp David!
"While Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don't think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great!"
"Yes, I am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements. Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also!"
"I was right about Comey, CROOKED COP!"
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, which is happening, and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
"Looking like our great South Carolina could get hit MUCH harder than first thought. Georgia and North Carolina also. It's moving around and very hard to predict, except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!"
"Just watched Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and many other Democrats, wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China, which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse). We are taking in $Billions. Will be big for Farmers and ALL!"
"Being scolded by failed former 'Intelligence' officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don't have a clue. They really set our Country back,."
".but now we are moving forward like never before. We are winning again, and we are respected again!"
"The vindication belongs to the President for firing James Comey. It was clearly the right thing to do. You don't want an FBI Director with Jim Comey's ethics.' Jason Riley, Wall Street Journal"
Just briefed by Attorney General Barr about the shootings in Texas. FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged. More to follow.
"Peter Morici, Economist Tariffs will not impact American consumers that much because the Chinese currency has gone down, which gives our importers a discount. Importers can find suppliers outside of China. Absolutely worth it, we don't want to be servants to the Chinese! This"
.is about American Freedom. Redirect the supply chain. There is no reason to buy everything from China!
"James Comey has been rebuked at the highest level, with much more to come. An IG Report doesn't get any stronger, calling him dangerous, insubordinate. THANK GOODNESS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED, BECAUSE IF HE WASN'T ELECTED, THESE PEOPLE WOULD STILL BE IN POWER. Two more.."
".reports are coming. Comey very vulnerable. But where is the Supreme Court. Where is Justice Roberts? If you lie to a court, you should be held in contempt. So, if you abused the FISA, you must be held accountable. I hope Justice Roberts will take action.' Jason Chaffetz, Fox"
Comey and McCabe (and more) are Dirty Cops.' Joe DiGenova
"In addition to Florida South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!"
"Pray for the people in the Bahamas. Being hit like never before, Category 5. Almost 200 MPH winds."
"We hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those channels.' Third Circuit, Court of Appeals. 'Lou, that's why this next Election is so important, the soul of America. They want to take religion out of American lives. Thank God for judges like."
"Since my election, many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our Country, and the Stock Market is up over 50%. If you followed the advice of the Failing New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, you'd be doing VERY poorly you'd be angry and hurt. He never got it!"
".and watched. NAFTA is the worst Trade Deal ever made terrible for labor and Richard let it stand. No wonder unions are losing so much. The workers will vote for me in 2020 (lowest unemployment, most jobs ever), and should stop paying exorbitant $ Dues, not worth it!"
"The Amazon Washington Post did a story that I brought racist attacks against the 'Squad.' No, they brought racist attacks against our Nation. All I do is call them out for the horrible things they have said. The Democrats have become the Party of the Squad!"
"The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do 'fact checking' anymore, and are only looking for the 'kill.' They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt.."
".The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!"
".when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some 'hurt.' Always good to be prepared! But the Fake News is only interested in demeaning and belittling. Didn't play my whole sentence or statement. Bad people!"
"Brazil will allow more American Ethanol to enter the country without Tariffs, a decision that Brazilian mills are celebrating. The seemingly counterintuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the South American nation and the U.S. for a"
"We are doing very well in our negotiations with China. While I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of 'ripoff USA'($600 B/year),16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a longshot."
".And then, think what happens to China when I win. Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime, China's Supply Chain will crumble and businesses, jobs and money will be gone!"
"For all of the 'geniuses' out there, many who have been in other administrations and 'taken to the cleaners' by China, that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember, the EU all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!"
"Germany, and so many other countries, have negative interest rates, 'they get paid for loaning money,' and our Federal Reserve fails to act! Remember, these are also our weak currency competitors!"
"Based on the IG Report, the whole Witch Hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal SCAM. The House of Representatives should now get back to work on drug prices, healthcare, infrastructure and all else. The Mueller Report showed No Collusion, No Obstruction!"
"The incompetent Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday. Many Pols exercise for hours, or travel for weeks. Me, I run through one of my courses (very inexpensive). President Obama would fly to Hawaii. Kahn should focus on."

4. The U.S. now leads the world in energy production BUT 5. Who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water? AMERICA!

"This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!"
"Absolutely nothing is more important than going back getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation. We had an administration using America's Spying Apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election. Those are all known, undisputed"
".facts, and that should terrify every American regardless of their political stripe. The idea that all of that information hasn't already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are, and how terrified they are about what's going to happen when that."
"In the early days of the hurricane, when it was predicted that Dorian would go through Miami or West Palm Beach, even before it reached the Bahamas, certain models strongly suggested that Alabama Georgia would be hit as it made its way through Florida to the Gulf."
".Instead it turned North and went up the coast, where it continues now. In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!"
".said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television. Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? ABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard!"
"Alabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That's why they're the Fake News!"
Really Good Jobs Numbers!
"After almost 3 years in my Administration, Jason Greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector. Jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer."
.His dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won't be forgotten. He will be missed. Thank you Jason!
"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!"
.have the discretion to end the program that President Obama began in his discretion. That program was unlawful to begin with. I think it's very unlikely that the SCOTUS is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program. DACA Is unlawful.' ..
".President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA, and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event, how can he have the right to sign and I don't have the right to 'unsigned.' Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers."
"DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn't feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!"
"The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn't). Check out maps.."
".This nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate! The LameStream Media and their Democrat.."
.partner should start playing it straight. It would be so much better for our Country!
"Great job by FEMA, Law Enforcement, First Responders, U.S. Coast Guard, and ALL! Keep going, we all appreciate what you are doing!"
The Economy is great. The only thing adding to 'uncertainty' is the Fake News!
"China is eating the Tariffs.' Billions pouring into USA. Targeted Patriot Farmers getting massive Dollars from the incoming Tariffs! Good Jobs Numbers, No Inflation(Fed). China having worst year in decades. Talks happening, good for all!"
".that were not hit and that are in good condition. Any cruise ship companies willing to act as stationary housing, etc., I am sure would be appreciated!"
"PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!"
"China just enacted a major stimulus plan. With all the Tariffs THEY are paying to the USA, Billions and Billions of Dollars, they need it! In the meantime, our Federal Reserve sits back and does NOTHING!"
"Thank you to Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the United States and me, their would have been many more casualties. I give all credit to FEMA, the U.S. Coast Guard, the brave people of the Bahamas.."
"Russia and Ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners. Very good news, perhaps a first giant step to peace. Congratulations to both countries!"
"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
"The Failing New York Times stated, in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book),'Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.' THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said, VERY EARLY ON, that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.."
"FAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story, but the LameStream Media just won't let it alone. They always have to have the last word, even though they know they are defrauding deceiving the public. The public knows that the Media is corrupt!"
"Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.."
".an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn't, they."
".only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?"
Leakin' Lyin' James Comey!
WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL
"Looking forward to being in the North Carolina tomorrow night. We're having a BIG RALLY for a great guy, Dan Bishop. Strong on Crime, Borders, your Military and our Vets, we need Dan Bishop in Washington badly. His opponent is WEAK on Crime, Borders, and against your 2nd A."
"When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn't come close."
"North Carolina, vote for Dan Bishop tomorrow. We need him badly in Washington! His opponent is a far left Sanctuary Cities supporter."
"but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his reelect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!"
"House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people, and real leaders, to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems, it is a better way to go. Fewer people, in the end, will leave!"
"94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!"
"..that this Administration has done. They don't talk about the great economy, the big tax and regulation cuts, the rebuilding of the Military, 'Choice' at our VA, our Vets, Judges and Supreme Court Justices, the Border Wall going up, lowest crime numbers, 2nd A, and so much more!"
"I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME"
"A lot of Fake News is being reported that I overruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban. This Story is False! I always think it is good to meet and talk, but in this case I decided not to. The Dishonest Media likes to create"
"the look of turmoil in the White House, of which there is none. I view much of the media as simply an arm of the Democrat Party. They are corrupt, and they are extremely upset at how well our Country is doing under MY Leadership, including"
"the Economy, where there is NO Recession, much to the regret of the LameStream Media! They are working overtime to help the Democrats win in 2020, but that will NEVER HAPPEN, Americans are too smart!"
"We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
To every one of the HEROES we recognized today — THANK YOU and God Bless You All!
"Departing MCAS Cherry Point in North Carolina for Fayetteville, North Carolina. This is amazing!"
"Received an update on Air Force One at MCAS Cherry Point in North Carolina, regarding damage caused by Hurricane Dorian."
"NORTH CAROLINA, VOTE FOR DAN BISHOP TODAY. WE NEED HIM BADLY IN WASHINGTON!"
"ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!"
"One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever!"
Vote today for Dan Bishop. Will be great for North Carolina and our Country!
"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore."
".I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week."
Incredible progress being made at the Southern Border!
"I am pleased to endorse Governor Mike Parson of Missouri. He is very Popular, Strong, and knows what he is doing he gets it! Based on the fact that Mike has announced he will run again in 2020 for Governor, Mike Parson has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
"Senator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska. He is great with our Vets, the Military, and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border, Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
Greg Murphy is a big winner in North Carolina 03. Much bigger margins than originally anticipated. Congratulations Greg!
BIG NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!
"Greg Murphy won big, 62% to 37%, in North Carolina 03, the Fake News barely covered the race. The win was far bigger than anticipated there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory. So we had TWO BIG VICTORIES tonight, Greg Dan!"
"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet.."
.The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na?veté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads.
"In a hypothetical poll, done by one of the worst pollsters of them all, the Amazon Washington Post/ABC, which predicted I would lose to Crooked Hillary by 15 points (how did that work out?), Sleepy Joe, Pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the General Election."
".This is a phony suppression poll, meant to build up their Democrat partners. I haven't even started campaigning yet, and am constantly fighting Fake News like Russia, Russia, Russia. Look at North Carolina last night. Dan Bishop, down big in the Polls, WINS. Easier than 2016!"
"If it weren't for the never ending Fake News about me, and with all that I have done (more than any other President in the first 2 1/2 years!), I would be leading the 'Partners' of the LameStream Media by 20 points. Sorry, but true!"
Leaving the White House soon to speak at the Pentagon. My great honor!
"At the request of the Vice Premier of China, Liu He, and due to the fact that the People's Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary."
".on October 1st, we have agreed, as a gesture of good will, to move the increased Tariffs on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%), from October 1st to October 15th."
"I had an excellent telephone conversation with Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of Mexico, talking about Southern Border Security, and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries."
.The Southern Border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by Democrats not agreeing to do anything on Loopholes or Asylum!
"The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress, and elsewhere!"
"European Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!"
It is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!
Some really big Court wins on the Border lately!
"We can't beat him, so lets impeach him!' Democrat Rep. Al Green"
Hello Baltimore!
"How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military Choice for Vets"
".Became Number 1 in World Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony James Comey.."
".IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You don't impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!"
"Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!."
".VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!"
"The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!"
"While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes, we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let's get counterfeits off the market, and keep young children from Vaping!"
A Very Stable Genius!' Thank you.
"Who the hell is JoyAnn Reid? Never met her, she knows ZERO about me, has NO talent, and truly doesn't have the 'it' factor needed for success in showbiz. Had a bad reputation, and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me. Low Ratings. Fake News!"
94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party! Tuesday night in the Great State of North Carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
"I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance."
.between our two countries. I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!
"The Taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. Killing 12 people, including one great American soldier, was not a good idea. There are much better ways to set up a negotiation. The Taliban knows they made a big mistake, and they have no idea how to recover!"
"Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!"
"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"
"I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News, the Deep State, the Democrats, and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS, who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation), with the help of some truly great Republicans, and others. We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week)!"
"Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a tobedetermined amount."
.sufficient to keep the markets wellsupplied. I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States.
"Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!"
PLENTY OF OIL!
Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal!
"The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, 'No Conditions.' That is an incorrect statement (as usual!)."
".work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the 'Congressional Slush Fund,' and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!"
"Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don't need Middle Eastern Oil Gas, in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!"
"Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China's big devaluation of their currency, coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No InflationHighest Interest Rates"
"The United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can't believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell the Fed don't have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!"
"Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their 'airspace' when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We'll see?"
"They failed on the Mueller Report, they failed on Robert Mueller's testimony, they failed on everything else, so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea, except I will, and have always expected to, lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS.."
".for the privilege of being your President and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. I am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening, or filling up a gas tank at an airport I do not own. These Radical Left Democrats are CRAZY! Obama Netflix?"
"I call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story, and while you're at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony! They've taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation"
"She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management. The Times is DEAD, long live The New York Times!"
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
"We are all united by the same love of Country, the same devotion to family, and the same profound faith that America is blessed by the eternal grace of ALMIGHTY GOD! Bound by these convictions, we will campaign for every vote we will WIN the Great State of NEW MEXICO in 2020!"
"The New York Times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history. Not only is it losing a lot of money, but it is a journalistic disaster, being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves. It has become a very sad joke all all over the World. Witch Hunt hurt them"
"Just departed New Mexico for California, where we are delivering results!"
"The New York Times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It wasn't the editor, the Times knew everything. They are sick and desperate, losing in so many ways!"
"So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before. Strongest Military by far, biggest Economy (no longer even close), number one in Energy! MAGA KAG!"
I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!
"I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O'Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long hard with Robert. He will do a great job!"
". advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new U.S. Standard, but the cars will be."
".far safer and much less expensive. Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business."
"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!"
Thank you!
"All Polls, and some brand new Polls, show very little support for impeachment. Such a waste of time, especially with sooo much good that could be done, including prescription drug price reduction, healthcare, infrastructure etc."
GREAT progress on the Border Wall!
"Another Fake News story out there It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!"
".Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!"
Presidential Harassment!
"Because of my Administration, drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years — but the American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley's drug pricing bill very much, and it's great to see Speaker Pelosi's bill today. Let's get it done in a bipartisan way!"
"The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again! They think I may have had a 'dicey' conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a 'highly partisan' whistleblowers.."
".statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"
"Thank you, working hard!"
"Rachel CamposDuffy has written a wonderful book for children, 'Paloma Wants To Be Lady Freedom.' She and her husband, Sean Duffy, have done so much for our Country. Buy this book great for the kids!"
"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.."
".story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden's demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn't want to report!"
This is the real and only story!
"Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!"
"Some of the best Economic Numbers our Country has ever experienced are happening right now. This is despite a Crooked and Demented Deep State, and a probably illegal Democrat/Fake News Media Partnership the likes of which the world has never seen. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"The LameStream Media had a very bad week. They pushed numerous phony stories and got caught, especially The Failing New York Times, which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history, and The Amazon Washington Post. They are The Enemy of the People!"
"The Fake News Media nowadays not only doesn't check for the accuracy of the facts, they knowingly make up the facts. They even make up sources in order to protect their partners, the Democrats. It is so wrong, but they don't even care anymore. They have gone totally CRAZY!!!!"
"The real story involves Hunter Biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs.' Peter Schweizer Laura Ingraham Hunter made a fortune in Ukraine and in China. He knew nothing about Energy, or anything else."
"Go across the world and you'll see either very low interest rates, or negative rates. The President wants to be competitive with these other countries on this, but I don't think he'll fire Jay Powell (even if I should!).' We should always be paying less interest than others!"
Justice Kavanaugh should sue The Failing New York Times for all they are worth!
Now the Fake News Media says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a socalled 'whistleblower' who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con..
"..Breaking News The Ukrainian Government just said they weren't pressured at all during the 'nice' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That's the real story!"
Just leaving the Great State of Ohio for New York and a few big days at the United Nations. Your Country will be well represented!
.know the correct facts. Is he on our Country's side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff the Democrats again after years of being wrong?
This is the real corruption that the Fake News Media refuses to even acknowledge!
"Thank you, working hard!"
94% approval rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine."
".You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"
THANK YOU!
"The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!"
"Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!"
"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?"
They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don't know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!
"They (Dems) are scrambling for a theme and narrative. They've gone everywhere from Russian Hoax to Russian Collusionand now they've come to thisthey think they should have won the 2016 election, they think in their bizarre brains that they did"
"Great new book by the brilliant Andrew McCarthy, BALL OF COLLUSION, THE PLOT TO RIG AN ELECTION AND DESTROY A PRESIDENCY. Get it, and some other great new books which I will soon be recommending. They tell you about the Crooked Pols and the Witch Hunt that has now been exposed!"
There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!
"Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call got them by surprise!"
".taken out of Ukraine and China. Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat."
THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!
"A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!"
Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!
"Liddle' Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second hand information, 'is credible.' How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!"
"The President of Ukraine said that he was NOT pressured by me to do anything wrong. Can't have better testimony than that! As V.P., Biden had his son, on the other hand, take out millions of dollars by strong arming the Ukrainian President. Also looted millions from China. Bad!"
"..nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn't bad, it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!"
"Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn't exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it"
"sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!"
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said, of course, NO!"
IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!
Rep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!
The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!
"Sounding more and more like the socalled Whistleblower isn't a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"
"If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn't considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!"
I AM DRAINING THE SWAMP!
"Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
"They are trying to stop ME, because I am fighting for YOU!"
"How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been, Cut Record Taxes Regulations, fixed the VA gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years), so much more?"
".The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!"
"The Whistleblower's complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The socalled 'Whistleblower' knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic wrong, just like Liddle' Adam Schiff.."
".fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming libeling me. He must resign from Congress!"
"It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam), but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing, namely, the USMCA vote, Prescription Drug Price Reduction, Gun Safety, Infrastructure, and much more!"
"The only people that don't like my conversation with the new Ukrainian President are those that heard Rep. Adam Schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the House and public, words that I did not say but that he fabricated ( admitted to this fabrication). Sick!"
"Wishing a Happy New Year to all of those celebrating Rosh Hashanah in America, Israel, and around the World!"
"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the socalled 'Whistleblower,' represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress"
"His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud Treason.."
".In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the 'Whistleblower.' Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!"
"These Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are doing great harm to our Country. They are lying cheating like never before in our Country's history in order to destabilize the United States of America it's upcoming 2020 Election. They the Fake News Media are Dangerous Bad!"
"All that's swirling around us now is Impeachment. We talk about it day and night, it's what's on the news, there is NOTHING that has turned up that is Impeachable. Our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare. We need to get good stuff done. Let the people vote,."
"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats can't put down the Impeachment match. They know they couldn't beat him in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, and they're increasingly aware of the fact that they won't win against him in 2020, and Impeachment is the only tool they have to get."
The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
"The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!"
"Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?"
".place in TRADE, it's taking shape in Military Competition.' Johnathan Ward, author and China expert. We are winning, and we will win. They should not have broken the deal we had with them. Happy Birthday China!"
"Again, the President of Ukraine said there was NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME. Case closed!"
WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!
FakeWhistleblower
"Very simple! I was looking for Corruption and also why Germany, France and others in the European Union don't do more for Ukraine. Why is it always the USA that does so much and puts up so much money for Ukraine and other countries? By the way, the Bidens were corrupt!"
"The Fake News Media wants to stay as far away as possible from the Ukraine and China deals made by the Bidens. A Corrupt Media is so bad for our Country! In actuality, the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens, which is hard to do!"
THANK YOU!
"Today, I was proud to sign the Autism CARES Bill! We support research for Americans with Autism and their families. You are not forgotten, we are fighting for you!"
Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!
"The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle' Adam Schiff's fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!"
"So if the socalled 'Whistleblower' has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my 'perfect' call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi Schiff), why aren't we entitled to interview learn everything about."
".the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him. This is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better. No pressure at all (as confirmed by Ukrainian Pres.). It is just another Democrat Hoax!"
"As I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don't have a clue. Pathetic!"
"Why isn't Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed!"
"REPUBLICANS of Louisiana, it is really important for you to go out and vote on October 12th for either Eddie Rispone or Ralph Abraham (both Great), which will lead to a runoff against."

".People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their Godgiven rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!"
The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
"Louisiana Republicans must go out and vote REPUBLICAN in your Governor's race. A Republican will win if you can force a runoff! Early voting has started. Your 2nd Amendment, and much else, is at stake."
"I won the right to be a presidential candidate in California, in a major Court decision handed down yesterday. It was filed against me by the Radical Left Governor of that State to tremendous Media hoopla. The VICTORY, however, was barely covered by the Fake News. No surprise!"
"Massive sections of The Wall are being built at our Southern Border. It is going up rapidly, and built to the highest standards and specifications of the Border Patrol experts. It is actually an amazing structure! Our U.S. Military is doing a GREAT job."
"Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of, after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect), fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress, as though mine! He is sick!"
"All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening, even have a transcript. They have been at this 'stuff' from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!"
DONOTHINGDEMS
"Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!"
"All of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere, is driving the Stock Market, and your 401K's, down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!"
Nancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!
Democrats are trying to undo the Election regardless of FACTS!
"Adam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For a lowlife like Schiff, who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me, to demean a First in Class at West Point, is SAD!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223306. Get a better candidate this time, you'll need it!"
LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!
"The U.S. won a $7.5 Billion award from the World Trade Organization against the European Union, who has for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and more. This case going on for years, a nice victory!"

ELECTION INTERFERENCE!
Great time at The Villages in Florida today. Sorry we couldn't get everybody in. I will be back soon!
There wasn't ANYTHING said wrong in my conversation with the Ukrainian President. This is a Democrat Scam!
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
"Today at The Villages in Florida, it was my great honor to sign an Executive Order on protecting and improving Medicare for our Nation's Seniors. Today's action is only the latest of many important steps we are taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American People!"
The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
"As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!"
"We are simultaneously fighting the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party. Always tough to beat the 'Press,' but people are beginning to see how totally CORRUPT they are, and it makes our job a whole lot easier!"
They (Do Nothing Dems) are trying to nullify an election' Joe diGenova
"As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!"
"Breaking News Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!)."
"The Whistleblower, who had the facts wrong about the phone call, reached out, and more, to the Democrat controlled House Intelligence Committee. Schiff never told us about this!"
"When your making an unsubstantiated statement that the President is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo, this witness has blown a big hole into that statement. The Ambassador put a dagger in the heart of Schiffs fairytale.' Rep. Lee Zeldin"

".it to Congress, and the American people, as though it was the statement of the President of the United States, me. He did it to fool Congress and the public in order to make me look BAD. He is a sick puppy!"
SHIFTY SCHIFF DUPED BY RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS!
NEW EXTREME DEMS NOW RUNNING THE PARTY!
"The socalled Whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is 'way off,' not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!"
"Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!"
"Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn't give it to him). He is so bad for R's!"
"Not only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election, but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!"
"So Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33,000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress, but I can't make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!"
"The first socalled second hand information 'Whistleblower' got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!"
95% Approval Rating in Republican Party. Thank you!
"The Democrats are lucky that they don't have any Mitt Romney types. They may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!"
"It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter, who was handed $100,000 a month (Plus,Plus) from a Ukrainian based company, even though he had no experience in energy,"
".and separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason. There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!"
"The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.."
".And by the way, I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden I just don't think it's going to happen. Sleepy Joe won't get to the starting gate, based on all of the money he his family probably 'extorted,' Joe should hang it up. I wouldn't want him dealing with China U!"

"Unemployment Rate just dropped to 3.5%, the lowest in more that 50 years. Is that an impeachable event for your President?"
"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan 'Whistleblower' lawyer"
".This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!"
"The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,.."

"..again said 'NO,' thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the 'sucker,' on NATO, on Trade, on everything. The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for."
".almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to.."
"figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their 'neighborhood.' They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!"

".down, watching over a quagmire, spending big dollars to do so. When I took over, our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back BLAST!"
"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over"
".the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!"
"So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F35 Fighter Jet. They have also been good to deal with, helping me to save many lives at Idlib Province, and returning, in very.."

Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can't price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!
Hasn't Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?
"Radical Left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is doing everything possible to stifle Free Speech despite a record sellout crowd at the Target Center. Presidents Clinton and Obama paid almost nothing! The Minneapolis Police have been incredible."

"Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren't doing the trick! Don't worry California, relief is on the way. The State doesn't get it!"
"The Whistleblower's facts have been so incorrect about my 'no pressure' conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower.."
..The Whistleblower's lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?
The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE..
".IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly carefully bringing our great soldiers military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President. Their total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!"
"The socalled Whistleblower, before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript, stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was 'crazy, frightening, and completely lacking in substance related to national security.' This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript!"
".No Pressure at all said Ukraine! Very congenial, a perfect call. The Whistleblower and others spoke BEFORE seeing the Transcript. Now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment!"
"President Obama said that he did not have the right to sign DACA, that it will never hold up in court. He signed it anyway! If the Supreme Court upholds DACA, it gives the President extraordinary powers, far greater than ever thought. If they do what is right and do not let"
".DACA stand, with all of its negative legal implications, the Republicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country, in very short order. It would actually benefit DACA, and be done the right way!"
"So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else's Campaign in order to win (that didn't work out so well), and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose. Will have 182 soon!"
"Only 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!"
"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment and I did nothing wrong. Joe's Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!"
Sleepy Joe Biden!
The hardest thing I have to do as President
"In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!"
Turkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time. They have been fighting forever. We have no soldiers or Military anywhere near the attack area. I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides. Some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to.
".the area and start a new war all over again. Turkey is a member of NATO. Others say STAY OUT, let the Kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). I say hit Turkey very hard financially with sanctions if they don't play by the rules! I am watching closely."
Why isn't the IG investigating his socalled Whistleblower? All bad info!
"Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House."
"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by Turkey, in Syria. We did our job perfectly! Now Turkey is attacking the Kurds, who have been fighting each other for 200 years."
".We have one of three choices Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!"
"Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!"
"I will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in USA), is suspect on your 2nd Amendment!"
"One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!"
"Kevin McAleenan has done an outstanding job as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down. Kevin now, after many years in Government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector."
".Congratulations Kevin, on a job well done! I will be announcing the new Acting Secretary next week. Many wonderful candidates!"
WHERE'S HUNTER?
"So funny to watch Steve Kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about China. He chocked, and looks weak and pathetic. Don't want him at the White House!"
"Louisiana REPUBLICANS, thank you for a great evening. Get out TOMORROW and VOTE REPUBLICAN! Send the Radical Democrat establishment a loud and clear message that you are going to FIRE your Democrat Governor, John Bel Edwards and send a Great Republican to the Governor's Mansion!"
"The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!"
"Louisiana, get out and vote REPUBLICAN before going to the big game today. A runoff will be a tremendous win for your Great State lower taxes and car insurance, and better protection of your 2nd Amendment! Fantastic being with you last night!"
"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!"
Happy National Farmers Day!
The Endless Wars Must End!
"The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand, 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side), are now fighting to keep us there. Don't listen to people that haven't got a clue. They have proven to be inept!"
"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?"
"Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey"
..The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!
Where's Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.
"We have become a far greater Economic Power than ever before, and we are using that power for WORLD PEACE!"
"The Democrats are going to lose a lot of House Seats because of their Fraudulent use of Impeachment. Schiff fabricated phone call, a crime. Democrat Senate Seats will also be put at risk, even some that were supposedly safe. Look at Louisiana last night, North Carolina last week!"
"My deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED! Likewise financial services and other deal aspects, start preparing."
".I agreed not to increase Tariffs from 25% to 30% on October 15th. They will remain at 25%. The relationship with China is very good. We will finish out the large Phase One part of the deal, then head directly into Phase Two. The Phase One Deal can be finalized signed soon!"
CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS RANCHERS!
"Congressman Adam Schiff, who when seeing the REAL Ukraine phone call Transcript decided he'd better make up one of his own. 'I'm going to say this only SEVEN times, so you better listen good. I want you to MAKE UP DIRT ON MY POLITICAL OPPONENT, UNDERSTAND, LOTS OF IT, AND.."
"The U.S. has the worst of the ISIS prisoners. Turkey and the Kurds must not let them escape. Europe should have taken them back after numerous requests. They should do it now. They will never come to, or be allowed in, the United States!"
"Somebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox, who will never be his father (and my friend), Mike Wallace, that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial good one. It was only Schiff's made up version of that conversation that was bad!"
"Adam Schiff now doesn't seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower's identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.."
".Democrat's game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript, and when Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister said there was NO PRESSURE, very normal talk! A total Impeachment Scam!"
".Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly. Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!"
The same people who got us into the Middle East mess are the people who most want to stay there!
Happy Columbus Day!
Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!
America First!
"The Fox Impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect. This was announced on Friday. Despite this, the Corrupt New York Times used this poll in one of its stories, no mention."
"To his credit the Europeans didn't step up to deal with this ISIS problem it's a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today. Now, Angela Merkel of Germany is finally stepping up and telling Turkey to back off."
"After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria."
".and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!"
"Some people want the United States to protect the 7,000 mile away Border of Syria, presided over by Bashar alAssad, our enemy. At the same time, Syria and whoever they chose to help, wants naturally to protect the Kurds."
".I would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America. And by the way, numbers are way down and the WALL is being built!"
"Shifty Schiff now seems to think they don't need the Whistleblower, who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcript. Also, the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!"
"Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for 9 hours each, not selective leaks."
"Just out MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER, EVER, EVER! How about saying it this way, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! Also, MORE PEOPLE WORKING TODAY IN THE USA THAN AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY! Tough numbers for the Radical Left Democrats to beat! Impeach the Pres."
.He loves our Military and supports our Vets! Get out and Vote for Tate Reeves on November 5th. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!
"Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says can't testify, the reason he can't testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud totally different from the actual transcribed call"
You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!
"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Just won two Congressional Seats in North Carolina, a Governors runoff in Louisiana, which Republicans should now win! Because of Impeachment Fraud, we will easily take back the House, add in the Senate, again win Pres!"
"Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!"
"Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!"
"Senator Rand Paul just wrote a great book, 'The Case Against Socialism' which is now out. Highly recommended as America was founded on LIBERTY INDEPENDENCE not government coercion, domination control. We were born free, and will stay free, as long as I am your President!"
"Guatemala, Honduras El Salvador have all signed historic Asylum Cooperation Agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling. To further accelerate this progress, the U.S. will shortly be approving targeted assistance in the areas of law enforcement security."
"THANK YOU, WORKING HARD!"
FAKE NEWS!
Do you think they like me?
Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!
"The Do Nothing Democrats, Pelosi and Schumer stormed out of the Cabinet Room!"
"Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her 'upstairs,' or she just plain doesn't like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!"
"This President is the most patriotic President I've seen in many years. He is going to do what is good for Americans.' Congressman Brian Babin, Texas. Thank you Brian!"
"Years of BAD GOVERNMENT, such a sorry thing to see!"
"Hope all House Republicans, and honest House Democrats, will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President, me. Most have never seen such a thing!"
"About 500,000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president leading for a 'political settlement' to that civil war. Media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter.' BuckSexton"
"I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops bring them home from the ridiculous costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what's happening here?"
"My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!"
This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some 'tough' love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!
"This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!"
"See you soon Dallas, Texas!"
"..this thinking years ago. Instead, it was always held together with very weak bandaids, in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides a really good chance for success. The U.S. has secured the Oil, the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds Turkey."
".I have just been notified that some European Nations are now willing, for the first time, to take the ISIS Fighters that came from their nations. This is good news, but should have been done after WE captured them. Anyway, big progress being made!!!!"
"Can you believe I am doing this important work for our Country, and have to deal with Corrupt Adam Schiff and the Do Nothing Democrats at the same time? It was not intended to be this way for a President!"
I want to thank Secretary of Energy Rick Perry for the outstanding job he has done. He will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests. Rick was a great Governor of Texas and a great Secretary of Energy.
".He is also my friend! At the same time, I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy. Dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!"
"Think of how many lives we saved in Syria and Turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday. Thousands and thousands, and maybe many more!"
REPUBLICANS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND FIGHT!
"Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt, are turning out to be good for me some really good! He's got all meetings locked down, no transparency, only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!"
"Susan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan, you were a disaster."
StopTheCoup
"Such a disgrace that the Do Nothing Democrats are doing just as their name suggests, Doing Nothing! USMCA anyone?"
"I don't see anything that constitutes an Impeachable offense Nothing here rises to the level of Impeachment. The Democrats are making a mistake with this secrecy.' Kenn Starr, former Special Prosecutor"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton just called the respected environmentalist and Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, a 'Russian Asset.' They need a Green Party more than ever after looking at the Democrats disastrous environmental program!"
The President never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about LACK OF SUPPORT FROM OTHER NATIONS and CONCERNS OVER CORRUPTION.' Yesterday's Mick Mulvaney statement
"..its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!"
"So now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard 'a Russian favorite,' and Jill Stein 'a Russian asset.' As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary's gone Crazy!"
"The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.' Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars!"
"Pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9, including Corrupt Adam Schiff, to Jordan to check out Syria. She should find out why Obama drew The Red Line In the Sand, then did NOTHING, losing Syria all respect. I did something, 58 missiles. One million died under Obama's mistake!"
"This Scam going on right now by the Democrats against the Republican Party, and me, was all about a perfect phone call I had with the Ukrainian President. He's already stated, NO PRESSURE! Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the 'informant?' All gone.."
.because their socalled story didn't come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. Was it a Corrupt Adam Schiff con? Why didn't the IG see this? When do we depose Shifty Schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this..
".fiction to Congress and the American People? I demand his deposition. He is a fraud, just like the Russia Hoax was, and the Ukraine Hoax is now. When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country, when do the Republicans finally fight back?"
"Great new book by wonderful and very street smart author Dan Bongino, EXONERATED, THE FAILED TAKEDOWN OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BY THE SWAMP. Dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Nevertheless, the Scam continues!"
"Censure (at least) Corrupt Adam Schiff! After what he got caught doing, any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest.are you listening Dems?"
"Doral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats their Partner, the Fake News Media! I'm surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary! We'll find someplace else!"
"So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here a lynching. But we will WIN!"
Thank you Republicans. 185 out of 185 present voted for 'US' last night. Really good!
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"Can't believe that Nervous Nancy Pelosi isn't moving faster on USMCA. Her people want it, they don't know why she isn't putting it up for a bipartisan vote. Taking too long!"
"Good news seems to be happening with respect to Turkey, Syria and the Middle East. Further reports to come later!"
Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!
"Young campus Conservatives are flocking to Turning Point USA other Conservative speaker events all over the Country, AND IN RECORD NUMBERS. Thousands of students are turning out. 'I just want to compliment the President of the United States for signing that historic Executive.."
.Order a couple of months ago saying that any school that does not uphold the First Amendment Rights of its students will lose Federal Funding. We have seen a huge change in how the Universities interact with us as a national local student organization. Our studends.
Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 1100 A.M. from the White House. Thank you!
Where's the Whistleblower?
".Does anybody think this is fair? Even though there was no quid pro quo, I'm sure they would like to try. Worse than the Dems!"
"(Kiddingly) We're building a Wall in Colorado'(then stated, 'we're not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we're building on the Border') refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!"
"The Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn't lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate. Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise, and way too slow to cut!"
"Thank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!"
The Oil Fields discussed in my speech on Turkey/Kurds yesterday were held by ISIS until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!
"Where is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President? Why did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the socalled Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!"
"So Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio has finally dropped out of the race for President, registering ZERO in the polls unable to even qualify for the debate stage. See Tim, it's not so easy out there if you don't know what you're doing. He wasn't effective for USA workers, just talk!"
Turkey fully understands not to fire on the Kurds as they leave what will be known as the Safe Zone for other fairly nearby areas. I don't have to repeat that large scale Sanctions will be imposed for violations. Going well! ISIS secured by Kurds with Turkey ready as backup..
".USA has gained Trillions of Dollars in wealth since November 2016. All others way down. Our power is Economic before having to use our newly rebuilt Military, a much better alternative. Oil is secured. Our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then."
".COMING HOME! We were supposed to be there for 30 days That was 10 years ago. When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED!"
Heading to South Carolina!
".in the basement of the United States Capitol! They cannot win at the ballot box. Their sham for the past 3 years continues. The good news is that the American People get it, which will be proven once again on November 3, 2020!"
To Tim The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe!
"Democrats just announced that they no longer want the Whistleblower to testify. But everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either), which they don't want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself.."
".The entire Impeachment Scam was based on my perfect Ukrainian call, and the Whistleblowers account of that call, which turned out to be false (a fraud?). Once I released the actual call, their entire case fell apart. The Democrats must end this Scam now. Witch Hunt!"
My lawyers should sue the Democrats and Shifty Adam Schiff for fraud!
General Michael Flynn's attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that FBI Agents manipulated records against him. They say that James Clapper told a reporter to 'take a kill shot at Flynn. This has been a complete setup of Michael Flynn.
".They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard Jill Stein with the same thingSICK), and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against.."
"..the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence information, as are Clapper Brennan all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.'(Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!"
"Had a beautiful dinner last night at Camp David in celebration of the 10th Wedding Anniversary of Ivanka and Jared. Attended by a small number of family and friends, it could not have been nicer. Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!"
"I can't believe that Nancy Pelosi's District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars and all she works on is Impeachment.."
".We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply. Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!"
The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!
".greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it. This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!"
"The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!"
Where's the Whistleblower?
"LOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders. He is crushing Louisiana's economy and your Second Amendment rights."
Something very big has just happened!
"The SP just hit an ALL TIME HIGH. This is a big win for jobs, 401K's, and, frankly, EVERYONE! Our Country is doing great. Even killed long sought ISIS murderer, AlBaghdadi. We are stronger than ever before, with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!"
"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr alBaghdadi!"
"Americans know by now that the Impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the President from office.' J.J. Crovatto Don't worry J.J., Schiff is a leaker corrupt politician who made up what I said on the call in order to hurt the Republican Party me!"
"The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff, when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress, together with numerous others on Shifty's side. Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc. The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!"
"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!"
Just confirmed that Abu Bakr alBaghdadi's number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot Now he is also Dead!
"A great new book just out, 'The Plot Against the President. The True Story Of How Congressman Devin Nunez Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal In U.S. History.' Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!"
Consumer Confidence number very good. Housing sales in September up nicely. Economy Rocks!
"Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!"
"Republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that.."
"..the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one. As he said, 'No Pressure.' This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected. Rupublicans, go with Substance and close it out!"
The Greatest Economy in American History!
A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post (which is no longer available at the White House!). He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!
Our Country cannot afford for the Democrats in Congress to take a one year vacation from any productive legislation just because they would rather obsess over Impeachment. ISIS other radical terrorists are not going to hit the pause button because Democrats won't fund
AMERICAN HERO!
".Your current Governor, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job with economic development (last in nation) and auto insurance (highest in nation) wants to raise your taxes BIG vote for Eddie starting Saturday!"
"Now is the time for Republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears. It would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime, but there is notnot in the transcripts, and not in the secret witness testimony that.."
"..the Dems have selectively leaked. Nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the President. Remember, the President knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people. Anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet, don't you think? This farce should."
"never be allowed to roll into a winter showtrial. Indeed, allowing a long, drawn out trial in the Senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the House. The crisis is of the Democrats own making, and it's up to Republicans to make sure this never happens."
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
"People are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar Rates are hurting"
".our manufacturers. We should have lower interest rates than Germany, Japan and all others. We are now, by far, the biggest and strongest Country, but the Fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage. China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway."
The Impeachment Hoax is hurting our Stock Market. The Do Nothing Democrats don't care!
The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!
"While the Do Nothing Democrats FAIL the American People, and continue the Impeachment Scam, my Administration will continue to deliver REAL RESULTS, as seen over the past month, below!"
"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence. I cherish New York, and the people of.."
".New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse. I hated having to make."
".this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned. As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York. It will always have a special place in my heart!"
Chicago will never stop its crime wave with the current Superintendent of Police. It just won't happen! Thank you to Kevin Graham and all of the GREAT Chicago Police Officers I just had the privilege to meet. Tremendous crime fighting potential if allowed to do your thing!
"Wow, a blowout JOBS number just out, adjusted for revisions and the General Motors strike, 303,000. This is far greater than expectations. USA ROCKS!"
ISIS has a new leader. We know exactly who he is!
"Adam Schiff has taken all of the power for himself. That is very unfair. There were dozens of people on this call, yesterdays witness knew that and had no problems (nor did any of them). Facts matter, and that's why this is not about Impeachment.' Guy Lewis, former prosecutor"
"LOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders. He is crushing Louisiana's economy and your Second Amendment rights."
Stock Market up BIG! Record highs for SP 500 and NASDAQ. Enjoy!
"I love New York, but New York can never be great again under the current leadership of Governor Andrew Cuomo (the brother of Fredo), or Mayor Bill DeBlasio. Cuomo has weaponized the prosecutors to do his dirty work (and to keep him out of jams), a reason some don't want to be"
".in New York, and another reason they are leaving. Taxes and energy costs are way too high, Upstate is being allowed to die as other nearby states frack drill for Gold (oil) while reducing taxes creating jobs by the thousands. NYC is getting dirty unsafe again, as."
".our great police are being disrespected, even with water dumped on them, because a Mayor and Governor just don't 'have their backs.' New York's Finest must be cherished, respected and loved. Too many prople are leaving our special New York. Great leaders would work."
..with a President and Federal Government that wants our wonerful City and State to flourish and thrive. I Love New York!
Republicans have never been more unified than they are right now! The Dems are a mess under the corrupt leadership of Nervous Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Adam Schiff!
"Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was 'born for this.' I don't think so!"
You can't Impeach someone who hasn't done anything wrong!
The Whistleblower must come forward to explain why his account of the phone call with the Ukrainian President was so inaccurate (fraudulent?). Why did the Whistleblower deal with corrupt politician Shifty Adam Schiff and/or his committee?
The Whistleblower has disappeared. Where is the Whistleblower?
"..Every year, as the fire's rage California burns, it is the same thingand then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don't see close to the level of burn in other statesBut our teams are working well together in.."
".putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don't pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!"
"The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but, being an arm of the Democrat Party, don't want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!"
".Matt has been a GREAT Governor. Kentucky (I Love You!), please be sure to vote for Matt Bevin on TUESDAY. Matt will never let you down, and we have to send a strong signal to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats. See you on Monday night, VOTE TUESDAY!!!"
"Many people listened to my phone call with the Ukrainian President while it was being made. I never heard any complaints. The reason is that it was totally appropriate, I say perfect. Republicans have never been more unified, and my Republican Approval Rating is now 95%!"
The Angry Majority!
"The Democrats are Fixers, and they are working overtime to FIX the Impeachment 'Process' in order to hurt the Republican Party and me. Nancy Pelosi should instead Fix her broken District and Corrupt Adam should clean up manage the California forests which are always burning!"
"The Fake News Media is working hard so that information about the Whistleblower's identity, which may be very bad for them and their Democrat partners, never reaches the Public."
"I hope everyone in the Great State of Virginia will get out and VOTE on Tuesday in all of the local and state elections to send a signal to D.C. that you want lower taxes, a strong Military, Border 2nd Amendment, great healthcare, and must take care of our Vets. VOTE REPUBLICAN"
"Virginia has the best Unemployment and Economic numbers in the history of the State. If the Democrats get in, those numbers will go rapidly in the other direction. On Tuesday, Vote Republican!"
".should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiff's manipulated propaganda. House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty's rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar, leaker freak who is really the one who should be impeached!"
"marklevinshow Mark Levin 'We ought to talk about the substance of this phone call. We have the call, I don't know what we need witnesses for? Can't we read English? Do I need a Whistleblower to tell me what I'm reading? Do I need a Lt. C. to tell me? NO.' So plain and simple!"
"Great Republican Geary Higgins has my complete and total Endorsement for Virginia Senate, 13th District. He is strong on Crime, the Border, our Military, Cutting Taxes, and protecting your 2nd Amendment. Dem John Bell will take your guns raise your taxes. Vote for Geary Higgins"
What I said on the phone call with the Ukrainian President is 'perfectly' stated. There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning. This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!
The Whistleblower gave false information dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well!
"Many people say they know me, claiming to be 'best friends' and really close etc., when I don't know these people at all. This happens, I suppose, to all who become President. With that being stated, I don't know, to the best of my knowledge, a man named Michael Esposito.."
".I don't like him using my name to build his consulting company, or whatever. Please advise his clients and Administration officials accordingly."
Read the Transcript!
AllTime High for Stock Market and all the Fake News wants to talk about is the Impeachment Hoax!
"Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today. I know the Dems are saying that they have your vote locked up, but that would mean a long slide down. VOTE REPUBLICAN TODAY!"
"A wonderful family and friends from Utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other, with the result being many great American people killed, including young children, and some missing. If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these.."
".monsters, the United States stands ready, willing able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!"
"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!"
"So sad to see what is happening in New York where Governor Cuomo Mayor DeBlasio are letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened bad, onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining, because of them, city. The Radical Left Dems are killing our cities. NYPD Commissioner is resigning!"
Thank you so much CLUB 45. You are truly Great Americans. See you in Florida!
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"Thank you to Kurt Volker, U.S. Envoy to Ukraine, who said in his Congressional Testimony, just released, 'You asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo, et cetra. NONE, because I didn't know there was a quid pro quo.' Witch Hunt!"
Stock Markets (all three) hit another ALL TIME HISTORIC HIGH yesterday! You are sooo lucky to have me as your President (just kidding!). Spend your money well!
"Just had a meeting with top representatives from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan to help solve their long running dispute on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, one of the largest in the world, currently being built. The meeting went well and discussions will continue during the day!"
"A great evening last night in Kentucky and Mississippi for the Republican Party with 13 BIG WINS, including a Governorship in Mississippi. Congratulations to everyone!"
"Years ago, when Media was legitimate, people known as 'Fact Checkers' would always call to check and see if a story was accurate. Nowadays they don't use 'Fact Checkers' anymore, they just write whatever they want!"
".The LameStream Media, which is The Enemy of the People, is working overtime with made up stories in order to drive dissension and distrust!"
Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an 'anonymous' source that doesn't exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don't have freedom of the press!
"The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!"
Read the Transcript!
"Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney, the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case, except against the other side!"
"The Amazon Washington Post and three lowlife reporters, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey, and Carol Leonnig, wrote another Fake News story, without any sources (pure fiction), about Bill Barr myself. We both deny this story, which they knew before they wrote it. A garbage newspaper!"
The Radical Left Dems and LameStream Media are just trying to make it hard for Republicans and me to win in 2020. The new Impeachment Hoax is already turning against them!
Stock Market up big today. A New Record. Enjoy!
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
"Fake News is reporting that I am talking to Mark Burnett about doing a big show, perhaps The Apprentice, after the presidency, which I would assume they mean in 5 years. This is not true, never had such a conversation, don't even have time to think about it. False reporting!"
"Just finished reading my son Donald's just out new book, 'Triggered.' It is really good! He, along with many of us, was very unfairly treated. But we all fight back, and we always win!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiff's lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), the I.G., be part of the list!"
Thank you to LSU and Alabama for a great game!
Thank you Andrew. Meadow was watching and is so proud of her great father and family!
"Corrupt politician Adam Schiff wants people from the White House to testify in his and Pelosi's disgraceful Witch Hunt, yet he will not allow a White House lawyer, nor will he allow ANY of our requested witnesses. This is a first in due process and Congressional history!"
"The call to the Ukrainian President was PERFECT. Read the Transcript! There was NOTHING said that was in any way wrong. Republicans, don't be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!"
"If Iran is able to turn over to the U.S. kidnapped former FBI Agent Robert A. Levinson, who has been missing in Iran for 12 years, it would be a very positive step. At the same time, upon information belief, Iran is, has been, enriching uranium. THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD STEP!"
"A great new book just out, 'The Plot Against the President. The True Story Of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal In U.S. History.' Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!"
HAPPY VETERANS DAY!
"Will be meeting with representatives of the Vaping industry, together with medical professionals and individual state representatives, to come up with an acceptable solution to the Vaping and Ecigarette dilemma. Children's health safety, together with jobs, will be a focus!"
"So with one Rally by me at the end of the campaign, I lift the poll numbers of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin by 19 points, he just misses, every other Republican in the Commonwealth wins big, and the Fake News blames me for a bad night! OK! By the way, Mississippi won everything!"
"The lawyer for the Whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big Impeachment Scam! It should be ended and the Whistleblower, his lawyer and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigared for fraud!"
"Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven't even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me, and read it to all!"
"Today, we come together as one Nation to salute the Veterans of the United States Armed Forces the greatest warriors ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our Veterans risked everything for us. Now, it is our duty to serve and protect THEM every day of our lives!"
Where is the Whistleblower who gave so much false information? Must testify along with Schiff and others!
Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!
"Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES, NO LAWYER NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can't be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!"
"Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!"
"In order to continue being the most Transparent President in history, I will be releasing sometime this week the Transcript of the first, and therefore most important, phone call I had with the President of Ukraine. I am sure you will find it tantalizing!"
"The President has until September 30th to give this aid to Ukraine. He gets it out on September 11th., 3 weeks before the deadline. So, we give our ally aid, and Joe Biden is not investigated. Remember that, they get the aid and we get nothing in return. The Democrats."
"..'no pressure' put on him to investigate Sleepy Joe Biden even though, as President, I have an 'obligation' to look into corruption, and Biden's actions, on tape, about firing the prosecutor, and his son's taking millions of dollars, with no knowledge or talent, from a.."
".Ukrainian energy company, and more millions taken from China, and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money, are certainly looking very corrupt (to put it mildly!) to me. Both Bidens should be forced to testify in this No Due Process Scam!"
"I will be releasing the transcript of the first, and therefore more important, phone call with the Ukrainian President before week's end!"
Economy is BOOMING. Seems set to have yet another record day!
"Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from 'angels.' Some are very tough, hardened criminals. President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order, but would anyway. If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!"
"The circus is coming to town. The corrupt, compromised, coward congenital liar Adam Schiff Show on Capital Hill, brought to you by his raging psychotic Democrats the top allies in the Media Mob. Everything you're going to see in the next two weeks is rigged.."
".This is a phony showtrial. There is zero due process, none. It is yet another fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory. It is another Witch Hunt. This is what the Socialist Doemocrat Party has become. There's not one thing the Democrats have done in the past 3 years except try"
"Nancy Pelosi cares more about power than she does about principle. She did not want to go down this road. She realizes this is a huge loser for Democrats. The Founders envisioned the worst people being in politics, yet they couldn't envision this. You have these people taking"
NEVER TRUMPERS!
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
"Wow! Was just told that my son's book, 'Triggered,' is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!"
".RepRatcliffe asked the two 'star' witnesses, 'where is the impeachable event in that call?' Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, were unable to answer the question. That would be the end of a case run by normal people! but not Shifty!"
"Hit New Stock Market record again yesterday, the 20th time this year, with GREAT potential for the future. USA is where the action is. Companies and jobs are coming back like never before!"
Walmart announces great numbers. No impact from Tariffs (which are contributing $Billions to our Treasury). Inflation low (do you hear that Powell?)!
Where's the Fake Whistleblower?
"We continue to monitor the terrible events at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California through our ongoing communications with Local, State, and Federal Authorities."
".We send our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those tragically lost, and we pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded."
"Democrats must apologize to USA Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said that 'United States Ambassador Gordon Sondland did NOT link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former V.P. Joe Biden his son, Hunter Biden.."
".Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigation.' THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS NOW DEAD!"
"The Impeachment Witch Hunt should be over with the statement made last night by the President and Foreign Minister of Ukraine. Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the"
"filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE. She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long. Approve USMCA, which has been sitting on her desk for months!"
"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors."
".They call it 'serving at the pleasure of the President.' The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O."
"Another Record Stock Market, 21 times this year, despite an ongoing, totally unfounded, Witch Hunt, a Democrat Party that would love to see a nice, big, juicy recession. In actuality, the potential for the United States is unlimited. We will power through the Do Nothing Dems!"
"We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost), and also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!"
"Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job, jobs, jobs!"
"So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr Nellie, Steele all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn't they lie?."
.A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?
"Dow hits 28,000 FIRST TIME EVER, HIGHEST EVER! Gee, Pelosi Schitt have a good idea, 'lets Impeach the President.' If something like that ever happened, it would lead to the biggest FALL in Market History. It's called a Depression, not a Recession! So much for 401K's Jobs!"
Visited a great family of a young man under major surgery at the amazing Walter Reed Medical Center. Those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world. Also began phase one of my yearly physical. Everything very good (great!). Will complete next year.
"Our great Farmers will recieve another major round of 'cash,' compliments of China Tariffs, prior to Thanksgiving. The smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries. In the meantime, and as you may have noticed, China is starting to buy big again. Japan deal DONE. Enjoy!"
"Joe Ricketts, one of our Country's most successful businessmen, including being the owner of the Chicago Cubs, has just written a great new book, THE HARDER YOU WORK, THE LUCKIER YOU GET. So true! Much can be learned from Joe. Go get the book!"
The Do Nothing Dems are now doing even less and soooo much work to be done!
"The Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats are turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. That is very bad for our Country, and not what the Founders had in mind!!!!"
"Republicans others must remember, the Ukrainian President and Foreign Minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever. Also, they didn't even know the money wasn't paid, and got the money with no conditions. But why isn't Germany, France (Europe) paying?"
Where is the Fake Whistleblower?
"Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now. 95% A.R. This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!"
"Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where's USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday's DEFACE THE NATION."
".that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!"
"Just finished a very good cordial meeting at the White House with Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve. Everything was discussed including interest rates, negative interest, low inflation, easing, Dollar strength its effect on manufacturing, trade with China, E.U. others, etc."
Mark Levin speaking one week after I took office. This was always a planned COUP and the Radical Left Democrats will suffer at the polls in 2020!
"At my meeting with Jay Powell this morning, I protested fact that our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries. In fact, our rates should be lower than all others (we are the U.S.). Too strong a Dollar hurting manufacturers growth!"
NASDAQ UP 27% THIS YEAR ALONE!
"A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!"
"Congressman Van Drew (DNJ) We've spent millions of Dollars, in my opinion, tons of money, tons of time, tons of hurt, fracturing the Nation apart. I haven't seen this to be a good thing."
"Nancy Pelosi will go down as the least productive Speaker of the House in history. She is dominated by AOC Plus 3 and the Radical Left. Mexico and Canada, after waiting for 6 months to be approved, are ready to flee and who can blame them? Too bad!"
We join families of Kevin King Tim Weeks in celebrating their release from Taliban captivity. Thanks to President Ghani for his courageous support. Let's hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. Proud of my team!
"Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER! Ambassador Sondland asks U.S. President (me) 'What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas theories. What do you want? It was a very abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. He (the President) just said,"
".'I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO! TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING!' Later, Ambassador Sondland said that I told him, 'Good, go tell the truth!' This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!"
I WANT NOTHING!
Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn't care about American Workers!
"If this were a prizefight, they'd stop it!"
"During my visit yesterday to Austin, Texas, for the startup of the new Mac Pro, the discussion of a new one $billion campus, also in Texas, I asked Tim Cook to see if he could get Apple involved in building 5G in the U.S. They have it all Money, Technology, Vision Cook!l"
"The Republican Party, and me, had a GREAT day yesterday with respect to the phony Impeachment Hoax, yet, when I got home to the White House checked out the news coverage on much of television, you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event. FAKE CORRUPT NEWS!"
"Bob Mueller, after spending two years and 45 million dollars, went over all of my financials, my taxes, and found nothing. Now the Witch Hunt continues with local New York Democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal I have ever done. This has never happened to a.."
"..President before. What they are doing is not legal. But I'm clean, and when I release my financial statement (my decision) sometime prior to Election, it will only show one thing that I am much richer than people even thought And that is a good thing. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!"
"I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment! The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT, there was NOTHING said that was wrong. No pressure on Ukraine. Great corruption dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!"
"Corrupt politician Adam Schiff's lies are growing by the day. Keep fighting tough, Republicans, you are dealing with human scum who have taken Due Process and all of the Republican Party's rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in American History"
"..But we are winning big, and they will soon be on our turf."
.'Nothing gives Schiff jurisdiction over Impeachment.
The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!
Read the two Transcripts of Ukrainian calls!
"I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. My hearing is, and has been, great. Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I've even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!"
"Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel 'Does this reach the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors? My assessment of the evidence so far, NO WHERE CLOSE. The evidence is conflicting ambiguous. Ambassador Sondland's testimony stated that."
Iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire Internet System so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country.
".They want ZERO transparency, thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the Iranian Regime is causing!"
SCHIFF'S 'FACT' WITNESSES!
MARK LEVIN ON IMPEACHMENT HYSTERIA!
"While we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years, Americans still pay far too much for drugs other countries pay far less that is WRONG! We will soon be putting more options on the table"
Pelosi and her Do Nothing Democrats drug pricing bill doesn't do the trick. FEWER cures! FEWER treatments! Time for the Democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families
House Republicans are showing real LEADERSHIP and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices. Do Nothing Democrats are playing partisan politics with YOUR drug prices! We are READY to work together if they actually want to get something done!
"Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!"
"Joe Concha, The Hill 'In Emerson College Poll, Impeachment among independents, 49% Oppose, 34% Support. You see why Pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. Dems have to go home and explain why they haven't done something on Opioid crisis, drug prices, USMCA, the Border, etc."
"The Democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing. The Whistleblower, the guy who took his case to Schiff's staff first, is what really blows the lid off this entire saga. He worked for Biden on Ukraine policy when Biden was VP. He worked for deep state henchman John"
"Daniel Cameron, who just won the A.G. race in the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a young and very talented political star. You will be hearing much from Cameron in the years to come!"
"NEW YORK POST EDITORIAL. 'Worse Than Pointless. All those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal to change American's minds. Part of the problem is that Democrats already leaked the best evidence they had. More important, NOT ONE WITNESS OFFERED.."
"95% Approval Rate in the Republican Party, a record! Thank you!"
"Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, AOC and the rest of the Democrats are not getting important legislation done, hence, the Do Nothing Democrats. USMCA, National Defense Authorization Act, Gun Safety, Prescription Drug Prices, Infrastructure are dead in the water because of the Dems!"
"Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment, especially in swing states. 75% to 25%. Thank you!"
"Agnes, your great boy Ronald is looking down, very proud of you!"
"The Impeachment Scam is driving Republican Poll Numbers UP, UP, UP! Thank you Shifty."
"I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's trial was handled by the Navy. He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie's rank. Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration's.."
".contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction. Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer's services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. I thank Richard for his service commitment. Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the.."
".honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin. Admiral and now Ambassador to Norway Ken Braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new Secretary of the Navy. A man of great achievement and success, I know Ken will do an outstanding job!"
"Support for Impeachment is dropping like a rock, down into the 20's in some Polls. Dems should now get down to work and finally approve USMCA, and much more!"
Another new Stock Market Record. Enjoy!
"DOW, NASDAQ, SP 500 CLOSE AT RECORD HIGHS"
I will always protect our great warfighters. I've got your backs!
"The D.C. Wolves and Fake News Media are reading far too much into people being forced by Courts to testify before Congress. I am fighting for future Presidents and the Office of the President. Other than that, I would actually like people to testify. Don McGahn's respected."
"lawyer has already stated that I did nothing wrong. John Bolton is a patriot and may know that I held back the money from Ukraine because it is considered a corrupt country, I wanted to know why nearby European countries weren't putting up money also. Likewise, I would."
"love to have Mike Pompeo, Rick Perry, Mick Mulvaney and many others testify about the phony Impeachment Hoax. It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but, future Presidents should in no way be compromised. What has happened to me should never happen to another President!"
"New Stock Market Record today, AGAIN. Congratulations USA!"
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!
Just returned to the United States after spending a GREAT Thanksgiving with our Courageous American Warriors in Afghanistan!
"I will be representing our Country in London at NATO, while the Democrats are holding the most ridiculous Impeachment hearings in history. Read the Transcripts, NOTHING was done or said wrong! The Radical Left is undercutting our Country. Hearings scheduled on same dates as NATO!"
"On World AIDS Day, The First Lady and I express our support for those living with HIV/AIDS and mourn the lives lost. We reaffirm our commitment to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
".in America, community by community where we will eradicate AIDS in 10 years, program already started. American leadership has proven that together we can save lives."
"Great writer and historian, Doug Wead, has written a true (not Fake News) account of what is going on in Washington and the White House. His new book, INSIDE TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE, is an incredible description of a very exciting and successful time in our Country's history. Buy it!"
"Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers. Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries. The Federal."
"..Reserve should likewise act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates Loosen Fed!"
"U.S. Markets are up as much as 21% since the announcement of Tariffs on 3/1/2018 and the U.S. is taking in massive amounts of money (and giving some to our farmers, who have been targeted by China)!"
"The United States has outperformed the rest of the world in an eye popping fashion. I don't think we've seen numbers like that.' Mohamed ElErian, Allianz Chief Economic Adviser. But despite this there is tremendous potential for growth, far greater than most have understood!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats get 3 Constitutional lawyers for their Impeachment hoax (they will need them!), the Republicans get one. Oh, that sounds fair!"
Heading to Europe to represent our Country and fight hard for the American People while the Do Nothing Democrats purposely scheduled an Impeachment Hoax hearing on the same date as NATO. Not nice!
"The Republican Party has NEVER been so united! This Impeachment Scam is just a continuation of the 3 year Witch Hunt, but it is only bringing us even closer together!"
"When Lisa Page, the lover of Peter Strzok, talks about being 'crushed', and how innocent she is, ask her to read Peter's 'Insurance Policy' text, to her, just in case Hillary loses. Also, why were the lovers text messages scrubbed after he left Mueller. Where are they Lisa?"
"In the 3 decades before my election, NATO spending declined by twothirds, and only 3 other NATO members were meeting their financial obligations. Since I took office, the number of NATO allies fulfilling their obligations more than DOUBLED, and NATO spending increased by $130B!"
"Manufacturers are being held back by the strong Dollar, which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the Federal Reserve Which has called interest rates and quantitative tightening wrong from the first days of Jay Powell!"
"The Fed should lower rates (there is almost no inflation) and loosen, making us competitive with other nations, and manufacturing will SOAR! Dollar is very strong relative to others."
"Just landed in the United Kingdom, heading to London for NATO meetings tomorrow. Prior to landing I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?"
"Great progress has been made by NATO over the last three years. Countries other than the U.S. have agreed to pay 130 Billion Dollars more per year, and by 2024, that number will be 400 Billion Dollars. NATO will be richer and stronger than ever before."
".Just finished meetings with Turkey and Germany. Heading to a meeting now with those countries that have met their 2% GOALS, followed by meetings with Denmark and Italy."
".When today's meetings are over, I will be heading back to Washington. We won't be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!"
"The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO. I got along great with the NATO leaders, even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more, $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S., only deep respect!"
"When I said, in my phone call to the President of Ukraine, 'I would like you to do US a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' With the word 'us' I am referring to the United States, our Country. I then went on to say that"
".'I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people..' This, based on what I have seen, is their big point and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!"
"Tremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country, no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase, other countries have already increased by $130 Billionwith $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair."
"..trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to 'Clean the Swamp,' and that's what I am doing!"
"The Do Nothing, Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. They already gave up on the ridiculous Mueller 'stuff,' so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President."
.This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents. That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!
"Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she 'prays for the President.' I don't believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?"
Republican Approval Rating 95%. Thank you!
"The story today that we are sending 12,000 troops to Saudi Arabia is false or, to put it more accurately, Fake News!"
Where's the Fake Whistleblower? Where's Whistleblower number 2? Where's the phony informer who got it all wrong?
Do not believe any article or story you read or see that uses 'anonymous sources' having to do with trade or any other subject. Only accept information if it has an actual living name on it. The Fake News Media makes up many 'sources say' stories. Do not believe them!

"Read the Transcripts! Also, see where I say 'us' (our Country) as opposed to 'me' (meaning me) and where I then say that the Attorney General (of the United States) will call you. People still remember Schiff's made up and fraudulent version of my conversation. Witch Hunt!"
"While the world is not doing well economically, our Country is doing better, perhaps, than it has ever done before. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!"
"Hard to believe, but if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada, USMCA, up for a vote long ago, our economy would be even better. If she doesn't move quickly, it will collapse!"
Our Economy is the envy of the World!

"Any president has the authority to investigate corruption. The President himself released the transcript of the call. Now the Democrats have no evidence of a crime and no evidence of violating the law. This is a kangaroo court in the House, but it's going to go to the Senate,"

"Nadler just said that I 'pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election.' Ridiculous, and he knows that is not true. Both the President Foreign Minister of Ukraine said, many times, that there 'WAS NO PRESSURE.' Nadler and the Dems know this, but refuse to acknowledge!"
WITCH HUNT!

"replouiegohmert 'This is so surreal. For three years, this President has been harassed. He's been electronically surveilled, spied upon, allegations have never ceased, they continue, and their continuing today. At some point you would think you would look at the abuse.."
"..by Congress, by the Justice Department FBI friends of the Democrats, who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate. At some point somebody should have said, wait a minute, this is out of control, this train is off the tracks, it's time to get reasonable."
..What's gone on the last three years is not reasonable. The majority has been so abusive.
"Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for 'two and a half years.' In other words, she lied. This was the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats plan all along, long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!"
Looking like a big win for Boris in the U.K.!
Congratulations to Boris Johnson on his great WIN! Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris!

The Do Nothing Democrats have become the Party of lies and deception! The Republicans are the Party of the American Dream!
The Republican Party is more united now than at any time in its history by far!
"How do you get Impeached when you have done NOTHING wrong (a perfect call), have created the best economy in the history of our Country, rebuilt our Military, fixed the V.A. (Choice!), cut Taxes Regs, protected your 2nd A, created Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, and soooo much more? Crazy!"
Record Stock Market Jobs!
"The Wall Street Journal story on the China Deal is completely wrong, especially their statement on Tariffs. Fake News. They should find a better leaker!"
"We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China. They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product, Energy, and Manufactured Goods, plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder."
"..The Penalty Tariffs set for December 15th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal. We will begin negotiations on the Phase Two Deal immediately, rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election. This is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!"
"It's not fair that I'm being Impeached when I've done absolutely nothing wrong! The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have become the Party of Hate. They are so bad for our Country!"
"Independent voters are fed up and frustrated with the Democrats.' Congressman Michael Waltz, Florida"
".absolutely no pressure. I don't know of any crime that was committed where the actual victim wasn't aware of it.and, they got the call, they got the meeting, and they got the money. Unbelievably, the Democrats have weaponized the Impeachment process, they have."
"Chuck Schumer sat for years during the Obama Administration and watched as China ripped off the United States. He the Do Nothing Democrats did NOTHING as this $ carnage took place. Now, without even seeing it, he snipes at our GREAT new deal with China. Too bad Cryin' Chuck!"
"The last time I spoke to Debbie Dingell was her call thanking me for granting top memorial and funeral service honors for her then just departed husband, long time Congressman John Dingell. Now I watch her ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax. Really pathetic!"
"As bad as the I.G. Report is for the FBI and others, and it is really bad, remember that I.G. Horowitz was appointed by Obama. There was tremendous bias and guilt exposed, so obvious, but Horowitz couldn't get himself to say it. Big credibility loss. Obama knew everything!"
"So now Comey's admitting he was wrong. Wow, but he's only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others, Jim?"
"Approval Rating in Republican Party 95%, a Record! Overall Approval Rating 51%. Think of where I'd be without the never ending, 24 hour a day, phony Witch Hunt, that started 3 years ago!"
".of the most successful presidencies in history. Just in the last few days, incredible jobs numbers, giant trade deals, help for working families, and much more. Over the last 3 years, unemployment falling, earnings rising, criminal justice reform, the heartland revived,."
".of the most successful presidencies in history. Just in the last few days, incredible jobs numbers, giant trade deals, help for working families, and much more. Over the last 3 years, unemployment falling, earnings rising, criminal justice reform, the heartland revived,."
".energy independence, manufacturing resilience, illegal immigration coming down, the Wall going up, China confronted, the caliphate defeated, NAFTA renegotiated, our military rebuilt, NATO paying more, regulations costing less,.and much more. This is why they're."
"READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! The Impeachment Hoax is the greatest con job in the history of American politics! The Fake News Media, and their partner, the Democrat Party, are working overtime to make life for the United Republican Party, and all it stands for, as difficult as possible!"
"I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates. My record is so good on the Economy and all else, including debating, that perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates.."
".to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission. I will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime, the Commission on Presidential Debates is NOT authorized to speak for me (or R's)!"
New Stock Market high! I will never get bored of telling you that and we will never get tired of winning!
Congressman Jeff Van Drew is very popular in our great and very united Republican Party. It was a tribute to him that he was able to win his heavily Republican district as a Democrat. People like that are not easily replaceable!
"The Stock Market hit another Record High yesterday, number 133 in less than three years as your all time favorite President, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, want to impeach me. Don't worry, I have done nothing wrong. Actually, they have!"
Impeachment Poll numbers are starting to drop like a rock now that people are understanding better what this whole Democrat Scam is all about!
"The new USA Today Poll, just out, has me leading all of the Democrat contenders. That's hard to believe since the Fake News 3 year Scams and Witch Hunts, as phony as they are, just never seem to end. The American people are smart. They see the great economy, everything else!"
Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease. The Dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation. This is the time to do it. Exports would zoom!
"Senator Josh Hawley (RMo) 'They (the Dems) don't have anything. This whole thing is a joke, and it's time to get the President exonerated. The House has no evidence of any impeachable offense. There's nothing there, and they didn't even charge a crime. They've had their.."
"Democrat 'leadership,' despite their denials, are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous Impeachment. If they vote yes, it will be much easier for Republicans to win in 2020!"
"Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst! No wonder with people like her and Cryin' Chuck Schumer, D.C. has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who (and now we know for sure) SPIED on my campaign."
"So, if Comey the top people in the FBI were dirty cops and cheated on the FISA Court, wouldn't all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed? They went after me with the Fake Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary the DNC, which they illegally presented to FISA"
".They want to Impeach me (I'm not worried!), and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways. How can they do that and yet impeach a very successful (Economy Plus) President of the United States, who has done nothing wrong? These people are Crazy!"
"Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG! A terrible Thing. Read the Transcripts. This should never happen to another President again. Say a PRAYER!"
"It's sad. Here's a gentleman who came to the White House and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath. All they wanted to do is impeach him. They started the day after he was elected, even the day after he was sworn in. But this President came to Washington and."
".said, 'I'm going to clean up Washington, I'm going to help people.' He gave big tax cuts, he's made our military strong. They're mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do. History will record we're experiencing some of the best times we've ever.."
".had, while the Democrats are just looking out for elections. This President should just continue to fight like he's always fought, for himself for this Country. Continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs trade policies. That's what makes this President stand.."
"The evidence has to be overwhelming, and it is not. It's not even close.' Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel"
"In the end here, nothing happened. We don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate.."
"SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!"
100% Republican Vote. That's what people are talking about. The Republicans are united like never before!
"The Senate shall set the time and place of the trial.' If the Do Nothing Democrats decide, in their great wisdom, not to show up, they would lose by Default!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles not deliver them to the Senate, but it's Senate's call!"
"Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate, which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up! The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!"
"So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House, no lawyers, no witnesses, no nothing, they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually, they have zero proof of anything, they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!"
The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united! The Dem's case is so bad that they don't even want to go to trial!
"The reason the Democrats don't want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don't want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!"
"A far left magazine, or very 'progressive,' as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn't been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather.."
"I will be signing our 738 Billion Dollar Defense Spending Bill today. It will include 12 weeks Paid Parental Leave, gives our troops a raise, importantly creates the SPACE FORCE, SOUTHERN BORDER WALL FUNDING, repeals 'Cadillac Tax' on Health Plans, raises smoking age to 21! BIG!"
"Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchaes of agricultural product more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, Hong Kong (progress!)."
"I guess the magazine, 'Christianity Today,' is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!"
Nancy Pelosi is looking for a Quid Pro Quo with the Senate. Why aren't we Impeaching her?
To The Extraordinary Men and Women of the United States Military
To Our Incredible Federal Workforce
"Last year I signed legislation that gives our Veterans CHOICE, through private providers, and at urgent care facilities! Today we fully funded this $10 billion a year effort that gets our brave Veterans care quickly, and close to home."
"We will always provide for our Veterans and their mental health. I pushed Congress to provide $10 Billion for Vet mental health, suicide prevention outreach, and funding for my PREVENTS Initiative to end Vet suicide. Congress responded. A big win for our Vets!"
Honored to finally put an end to the 'Widow's Tax' and ensure that our surviving military spouses receive their full benefits. The spouses and families of our fallen heroes have suffered enough and WE must do everything in our power to ease the burden.
Broke all time Stock Market Record again today. 135 times since my 2016 Election Win. Thank you!
"Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes, ships, missiles, rockets and equipment of every kind, and all made right here in the USA. Additionally, we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!"
"Crazy Nancy wants to dictate terms on the Impeachment Hoax to the Republican Majority Senate, but striped away all Due Process, no lawyers or witnesses, on the Democrat Majority House. The Dems just wish it would all end. Their case is dead, their poll numbers are horrendous!"
"The Democrats and Crooked Hillary paid for provided a Fake Dossier, with phony information gotten from foreign sources, pushed it to the corrupt media Dirty Cops, have now been caught. They spied on my campaign, then tried to cover it up Just Like Watergate, but bigger!"
"Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress, and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate, and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once, she will do it again!"
"Nancy Pelosi, who has already lost the House Speakership once, is about to lose it again, is doing everything she can to delay the zero Republican vote Articles of Impeachment. She is trying to take over the Senate, Cryin' Chuck is trying to take over the trial. No way!."
".What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!"
Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that Republicans in the Senate should handle the Impeachment Hoax in the exact same manner as Democrats in the House handled their recent partisan scam? Why would it be different for Republicans than it was for the Radical Left Democrats?
NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come!
"STOCK MARKET CLOSES AT ALLTIME HIGH! What a great time for the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats to Impeach your favorite President, especially since he has not done anything wrong!"
"Everything we're seeing from Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer suggests that they're in real doubt about the evidence they've brought forth so far not being good enough, and are very, very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence. The only way to make this work is to.."
The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment. She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
"2019 HOLIDAY RETAIL SALES WERE UP 3.4% FROM LAST YEAR, THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN U.S. HISTORY. CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!"
"Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with 'no pressure.' She said it must be 'bipartisan"
"overwhelming,' but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also, very unfair with no Due Process, proper representation, or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren't allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!"
"Brad Blakeman 'I happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective, they don't meet the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, so I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss. At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with thatthere should be no trial."
"Nancy Pelosi's District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!"
"Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House, and she has no standing in the Senate.' Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District help the homeless there. A primary for N?"
"Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years, it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats their bogus Impeachment Scam. Bad for USA!"
"Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib Province. Don't do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage."
"California leads the nation, by far, in both the number of homeless people, and the percentage increase in the homeless population two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on that in her very down district, and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem!"
Thank YOU Indian Country for being such an IMPORTANT part of the American story! I recently signed 3 bills to support tribal sovereignty.
".and native culture S.216/Spokane Tribe, S.256/Native Languages and NDAA Sec. 2870 officially recognizing Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians. My great honor to do so!"
"California and New York must do something about their TREMENDOUS Homeless problems. They are setting records! If their Governors can't handle the situation, which they should be able to do very easily, they must call and 'politely' ask for help. Would be so easy with competence!"
I want to thank Rush Limbaugh for the tremendous support he has given to the MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Movement and our KEEP AMERICA GREAT Agenda! He is a major star who never wavered despite the Fake News Hits he has had to endure. His voice is far bigger than theirs!
"So sad to see that New York City and State are falling apart. All they want to do is investigate to make me hate them even more than I should. Governor Cuomo has lost control, and lost his mind. Very bad for the homeless and all!"
"The antiSemitic attack in Monsey, New York, on the 7th night of Hanukkah last night is horrific. We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of antiSemitism. Melania and I wish the victims a quick and full recovery."
"Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday's church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"
"The Democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the Senate in order to protect Sleepy Joe Biden, and expose the millions and millions of dollars that 'Where's' Hunter, possibly Joe, were paid by companies and countries for doing NOTHING. Joe wants no part of this mess!"
"Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!"
"Armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in Texas. If it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed, and highly proficient in using their weapon, the end result would have been catastrophic. A big THANK YOU to them!"
"President Putin of Russia called to thank me and the U.S. for informing them of a planned terrorist attack in the very beautiful city of Saint Petersburg. They were able to quickly apprehend the suspects, with many lives being saved. Great important coordination!"
I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15. The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!
"To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don't want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!"
"Very good meeting on the Middle East, the Military, and Trade. Heading back to The Southern White House (MaraLago!). Updates throughout the day."
Read the Transcripts!
"It's my opinion as a lawyer that the Articles of Impeachment are defective on their face, which means I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial. I don't think there should be a trial. I think it should be dismissed."
"The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site. Thank you to the President Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request."
".Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!"
The AntiBenghazi!
"The Fake News said I played golf today, and I did NOT! I had meeting in various locations, while closely monitoring the U.S. Embassy situation in Iraq, which I am still doing. The Corrupt Lamestream Media knew this but, not surprisingly, failed to report or correct!"
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
"A lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of Dirty (Filthy) Cops, politicians, government officials, and an investigation that was illegally started that SPIED on my campaign. The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!). If this."
".had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!"
"Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"
"General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number."
".of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!"
"The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year, for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq don't want to be dominated controlled by Iran, but ultimately, that is their choice. Over the last 15 years, Iran has gained more."
".and more control over Iraq, and the people of Iraq are not happy with that. It will never end well!"
".different places that he thought were wasteful, and the career staff, as they always do, pushed back, and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending U.S. taxpayer money. There was a back forth over the legal arguments, the W.H. decision was."
".followed, and then it was withdrawn. The Democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks. As Senator Josh Hawley just said, he's going to enter a Motion to Dismiss the Impeachment Trial because it's never actually been brought to trial."
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"As hard as I work, as successful as our Country has become with our Economy, our Military everything else, it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!"
"Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently."
".hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have.."
".targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level important to Iran the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!"
"The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation!"
"These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly fully strike back, perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!"
"The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian President's strong statement, NO PRESSURE get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!"
"Congress the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!"
IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!
"The homeless situation in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and many other Democrat Party run cities throughout the Nation is a state and local problem, not a federal problem."
".If however, the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility, and politely asks for help from the Federal Government, we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run Democrat Cities Great Again!"
"All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning."
"Pelosi doesn't want to hand over The Articles of Impeachment, which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like Shifty Schiff in the first place, because after all of these years of investigations and persecution, they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam!"
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
"Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi's War Powers Resolution. Also, remember her 'speed rush' in getting the Impeachment Hoax voted on done. Well, she never sent the Articles to the Senate. Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!"
"Breaking News The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just reversed a lower court decision gave us the go ahead to build one of the largest sections of the desperately needed Southern Border Wall, Four Billion Dollars. Entire Wall is under construction or getting ready to start!"

"Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are 'unhinged."
New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!

"To the leaders of Iran DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!"
".discretion, and only as a last resort.' Thank you to the great Michael Goodwin. Could not have said it better myself!"
"Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness, and so should she!"
"Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong? Read the Transcripts! A totally partisan Hoax, never happened before. House Republicans voted 1950, with three Dems voting with the Republicans. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!"
"House Republicans investigating origins of the Ukraine Whistleblower complaint. ICIG Michael Atkinson facing serious questions. 'The Democrats know the ICIG is a major problemdidn't release his testimony. Looks so much like everything else we've seen, from the Russia Hoax, to"
"Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!"
"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!"
"National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions protests have Iran 'choked off', will force them to negotiate. Actually, I couldn't care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and 'don't kill your protesters."
"Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved PreExisting Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate.."
".and, if Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives, your healthcare, that I have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far. I will always protect your PreExisting Conditions, the Dems will not!"
"Bernie Sander's volunteers are trashing Elizabeth 'Pocahontus' Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?"
"The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do, whether it's the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical Left, Do Nothing Democrats!"
"Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. Big progress!"
"The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was 'imminent' or not, was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesn't really matter because of his horrible past!"
"Really Big Breaking News (Kidding) Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!"
"We demand fairness' shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats, yet the Dems in the House wouldn't let us have 1 witness, no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witchhunt in the history of Congress!"
"I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with PreExisting Conditions. I am honored to have terminated the very unfair, costly and unpopular individual mandate for you!"
"We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer just said, 'The American people want a fair trial in the Senate.' True, but why didn't Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam 'Shifty' Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!"
GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!
"Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, from every race, religion, color creed. We are a movement for ALL AMERICANS who believe in fairness justice, equality dignity, opportunity safety. We are a big tent, a big party, w/ BIG IDEAS for the future!"
"Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!"
"One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country, and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!"
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is unbelievable, which it is, but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That's politics, but so bad for our great Country!"
"The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada, but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!"
I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!
The GOA got it exactly backwards. Here's what they said. The law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities to those Congress has enacted into law. It's exactly the opposite. The Constitution does not allow Congress to substitute its own priorities.
"Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn't get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn't want to he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did, he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!)."
"Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA, including the greatest economy in history, rebuilding our military, biggest ever tax regulation cuts, 2nd A!"
"Getting ready to meet the LSU Tigers, the National Champions. Great Coach, great Team, great School. Very exciting!"
"They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously. They are bringing him out of so important Iowa in order that, as a Senator, he sit through the Impeachment Hoax Trial. Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy"
".Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair, but that's the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch!"
Heading to Florida for big Republican Party event. New Stock Market Record. Jobs in USA at alltime high!

"The socalled 'Supreme Leader' of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!"

"A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall, built around New York to protect it from rare storms, is a costly, foolish environmentally unfriendly idea that, when needed, probably won't work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry, you'll just have to get your mops buckets ready!"
.BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
"I will be going to Austin, Texas. Leaving soon. Always like (love!) being in the Lone Star State. Speaking to our great Farmers. They hit 'paydirt' with our incredible new Trade Deals CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO, CANADA, SOUTH KOREA, and many others!"
I have never seen the Republican Party as Strong and as Unified as it is right now. Thank you!
"Now Mini Mike Bloomberg is critical of Jack Wilson, who saved perhaps hundreds of people in a Church because he was carrying a gun, and knew how to use it. Jack quickly killed the shooter, who was beginning a rampage. Mini is against the 2nd A. His ads are Fake, just like him!"
"The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights. This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!"
They didn't want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer is now asking for 'fairness', when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House. So, what else is new?"
USA! USA! USA!
"It was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017, that I was sworn into office. So appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY. AfricanAmerican Unemployment is the LOWEST in the history of our Country, by far. Also, best Poverty, Youth, and Employment numbers, ever. Great!"

"There is no evidence of a crime.' Robert Charles, Fmr Asst Secy of State. The crimes were committed by the other side!"
"Attorney Generals from 21 States are urging the Senate to reject Impeachment. They say the Articles have legal factual problems, and the Democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent. 'EVEN AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT UNDERMINES THE INTEGRITY.."
"The Democrat House would not give us lawyers, or not one witness, but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought, or even asked for? They had their chance, but pretended to rush. Most unfair corrupt hearing in Congressional history!"

"The Democrats Shifty Schiff, whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations, are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt, Honduras, Mexico. Witch Hunt!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this, he figures, they won't hit him as hard."
".during his hopeless 'presidential' campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all and he will be right!"
"The Democrats don't want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden's, the fake Whistleblower( his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the socalled 'informer', many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!"
Close race in Kansas!
I LOVE ALABAMA!

".intimidated by this national left wing media, that reduces most politicians and most public figures to whining, crying, puddles of cowardice it is really something to have a man in the White House who has a courageous heart and does what he says he will do."
"Any fair minded person watching the Senate trial today would be able to see how unfairly I have been treated and that this is indeed the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax that EVERYBODY, including the Democrats, truly knows it is. This should never be allowed to happen again!"
"You don't come to court and ask for witnesses after you've already presented your case, unless you know your case is not working. I think their real motivation is for them to keep this President busy. We're doing a great job on the economy, we're building our military, look.."

"Previous quote from the great Republican Senator, Jim Inhofe, of Oklahoma Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee"
All Democrats should watch this!
"The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before. In just two hours the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded. Shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call, more!"
"Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!"
"Great Editorial in today's Wall Street Journal, 'And Congress Shall Be King.' Bottom line 'The President becomes a vassal of King Congress. This is another reason for the Senate to repudiate this House Impeachment as its own abuse of power.' A partisan Hoax!"

"Kobe Bryant, despite being one of the truly great basketball players of all time, was just getting started in life. He loved his family so much, and had such strong passion for the future. The loss of his beautiful daughter, Gianna, makes this moment even more devastating."
..Melania and I send our warmest condolences to Vanessa and the wonderful Bryant family. May God be with you all!
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the"
"transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems. Additionally, I met with President Zelensky at the United Nations"
(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin antitank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.

READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
"Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant?"

"There is much talk that certain Democrats are going to be voting with Republicans on the Impeachment Hoax, so that the Senate can get back to the business of taking care of the American people. Sorry, but Cryin' Chuck Schumer will never let that happen!"

"Americans across the political spectrum are disgusted by the Washington Democrats' Partisan Hoaxes, Witch Hunts, Con Jobs. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat Party in droves, we are welcoming these voters to the Republican Party w/ wide open arms!"
THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting 'fairness', when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn't do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!"
Democrats 17 Witnesses. Republicans 0 Witnesses.
"No matter what you give to the Democrats, in the end, they will NEVER be satisfied. In the House, they gave us NOTHING!"
Getting a little exercise this morning!
"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don't want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, that includes the House Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!"

Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!
"When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?"
"The Democrat Party in Iowa really messed up, but the Republican Party did not. I had the largest reelection vote in the history of that great state, by far, beating President Obama's previous record by a lot. Also, 97% Plus of the vote! Thank you Iowa!"
"Market up big today on very good economic news. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
"My Approval Rating in the Republican Party 95%, a record! Big Iowa win. Approval Rating overall 53%, a new high. With our great Economy and other major successes, would be 20 points higher without the phony Witch Hunts and Hoaxes???"
It was a great and triumphant evening for our Country. Thank you for all of the nice remarks and wonderful reviews of my State of the Union Speech. It was my great honor to have done it!
"Nevada, I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you! Congress and previous Administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions my Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches I'm confident we can get it done!"
"Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but"
".he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!"
"The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer 'fried'. Nobody knows who the real winner is. Maybe it's Sleepy Joe, but it's not looking that way. They lost millions millions of dollars, all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!"
Off to North Carolina!
Iowa and New Hampshire will not be moved from the Primary Schedule as long as I am President. Great tradition!
"Another win just in. Nervous Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress sued me, thrown out. This one unanimous, in the D.C. Circuit. Witch Hunt!"
"I was very surprised disappointed that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against me on the Democrat's totally partisan Impeachment Hoax. No President has done more for the great people of West Virginia than me (Pensions), and that will."
".was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, 'OUT'."
"Crazy Nancy Pelosi's Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!), and my Polls, WAY UP, which was expected, but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races, including North Carolina, Kentucky, Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!"
"the worst weeks ever.' She could have had a much better week if Crazy Nancy, who is the most overrated person in politics (going to lose the House a second time), didn't bring the phony corrupt Impeachment Hoax. Dems can't do anything right, just look at the Iowa vote count!"
We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget. Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country's greatest ever Economy!
"Pete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons, from 19631986, and had more hits, 4,256, than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled, but only on his own team winning, and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It's Time!"
"Can't say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldn't understand anyway.."
"But, just like the people of West Virginia will no longer look at weak pathetic Joe Manchin the same (I got the Pension Bill approved, Manchin couldn't do it), the wonderful people of Utah will never look at 'grandstander' Mitt Romney with anything but contempt disgust!"
Thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews I have gotten on my State of the Union Speech. It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country!
"I grew up in New York City and, over many years, got to watch how GREAT NYC's 'Finest' are. Now, because of weak leadership at Governor Mayor, stand away (water thrown at them) regulations, and lack of support, our wonderful NYC police are under assault. Stop this now!"
"They are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin in West Virginia. He couldn't understand the Transcripts. Romney could, but didn't want to!"
"FBI Director Christopher Wray just admitted that the FISA Warrants and Survailence of my campaign were illegal. So was the Fake Dossier. THEREFORE, THE WHOLE SCAM INVESTIGATION, THE MUELLER REPORT AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THREE YEARS, WAS A FIXED HOAX. WHO PAYS THE PRICE?."
".This is the biggest political crime in American History, by far. SIMPLY PUT, THE PARTY IN POWER ILLEGALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION, IN ORDER TO CHANGE OR NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. Terrible!"
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"

"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!"
"Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great."
"Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won't!"
Meeting with U.S. Governors in a short while. All States are doing well. 'Thank you Mr. President.

"New Stock Market RECORD. Congratulations, spend your money wisely. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!!"
"When Jerome Powell started his testimony today, the Dow was up 125, heading higher. As he spoke it drifted steadily downward, as usual, and is now at 15. Germany other countries get paid to borrow money. We are more prime, but Fed Rate is too high, Dollar tough on exports."
"Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podesta's BROTHER? Wasn't he caught, forced to leave his firm, with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the 'other' side?"
"Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a 'nice cold beer' with her husband!"
"Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa, and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did, is it?"
"Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldn't ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?"
A very bad night for Mini Mike!
Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!
"The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story, but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldn't a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!"
Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!
It is very important for our Country's SECURITY that the United States Senate not vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution. We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness. Americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist Soleimani.
".If my hands were tied, Iran would have a field day. Sends a very bad signal. The Democrats are only doing this as an attempt to embarrass the Republican Party. Don't let it happen!"
"Ending surprise medical billing moving ahead in Congress! Thanks to Ways Means and Education/Labor Committees for your work on Bills to protect patients and end medical bill ripoffs! Work with Energy Commerce, HELP committees to send BIPARTISAN bill to my desk!"

DRAIN THE SWAMP! We want bad people out of our government!
"When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn't do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn't for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many X's, he misses the action just can't keep his mouth shut,."
".which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside said strongly that 'John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.' Wrong!"
"I'm seeing Governor Cuomo today at The White House. He must understand that National Security far exceeds politics. New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits harrassment, start cleaning itself up, and lowering taxes. Build relationships, but don't bring Fredo!"
"The President has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.' A.G. Barr This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!"
"I was very surprised disappointed that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against me on the Democrat's totally partisan Impeachment Hoax. No President has done more for the great people of West Virginia than me (Pensions), and that will."
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

"It has been two years since the tragedy in Parkland. We will always mourn the innocent lives taken from us 14 wonderful students and 3 terrific educators. Earlier this week, I met with families whose experiences from that horrible day still pierce the soul."
"Remember, will be at Daytona 500 tomorrow!"
Getting ready to go to the Daytona 500. Will be GREAT!
"Last week the Fake News said that a section of our powerful, under construction, Southern Border Wall 'fell over', trying to make it sound terrible, except the reason was that the concrete foundation was just poured soaking wet when big winds kicked in. Quickly fixed 'forever'."
HAPPY PRESIDENT'S DAY!
Completion of the Daytona 500 on Fox Network now. Enjoy!
".ever. Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
"Judge Jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury, whose also a lawyer, by the way. 'Madam foreperson, your a lawyer, you have a duty, an affirmative obligation, to reveal to us when we selected you the.."
..existence of these tweets in which you were so harshly negative about the President the people who support him. Don't you think we wanted to know that before we put you on this jury.' Pretty obvious he should (get a new trial). I think almost any judge in the Country..
"These were Mueller prosecutors, and the whole Mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited Fake Dossier, lying and forging documents to the FISA Court, and many other things. Everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is"
".badly tainted and, in my opinion, should be thrown out. Even Mueller's statement to Congress that he did not see me to become the FBI Director (again), has been proven false. The whole deal was a total SCAM. If I wasn't President, I'd be suing everyone all over the place"
.BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT!
"The Crooked DNC is working overtime to take the Democrat Nomination away from Bernie, AGAIN! Watch what happens to the Super Delegates in Round Two. A Rigged Convention!"
"The United States cannot, will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive. We want to sell"
".product and goods to China and other countries. That's what trade is all about. We don't want to make it impossible to do business with us. That will only mean that orders will go to someplace else. As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World."
".I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous. I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed, with no excuses"

"Judge Jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury, whose also a lawyer, by the way. 'Madam foreperson, you're a lawyer, you have a duty, an affirmative obligation, to reveal to us when we selected you the."

"What Mini Mike is doing is nothing less than a large scale illegal campaign contribution. He is 'spreading' money all over the place, only to have recipients of his cash payments, many former opponents, happily joining or supporting his campaign. Isn't that called a payoff? .."
"..Mini is illegally buying the Democrat Nomination. They are taking it away from Bernie again. Mini Mike, Major Party Nominations are not for sale! Good luck in the debate tomorrow night and remember, no standing on boxes!"
"Mini Mike. No, I would rather run against you!"
"I hope the Federal Judges Association will discuss the tremendous FISA Court abuse that has taken place with respect to the Mueller Investigation Scam, including the forging of documents and knowingly using the fake and totally discredited Dossier before the Court. Thank you!"
Congratulations to Eddie DeBartolo Jr. and your wonderful family of friends!
"Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is, that he doesn't respect our great farmers, or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with 'payoffs' all over the place?"
"Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!"
"Internal REAL Polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates. The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied. Their polls will be proven corrupt on November 3rd, just like the Fake News is corrupt!"
".for the wonderful job he has done, and we look forward to working with him closely, perhaps in another capacity within the Administration!"
"The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, lateterm abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker, the American Family, and the American Dream!"
"Thank you Arizona! With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep ON WINNING! America is thriving like never before, and the BEST IS YET TO COME!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!"
"John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did, there would be very serious ramifications!"
"Just arrived in Colorado, see everyone soon!"
"I was thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs tonight, beneath the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, with thousands of terrific, hardworking American Patriots. With your help, this November, we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Dems, and we are going to WIN Colorado!"
"Great Rally In Colorado. Thank you, will be back soon!"
"IF OUR FORMALLY TARGETED FARMERS NEED ADDITIONAL AID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA, MEXICO, CANADA AND OTHERS FULLY KICK IN, THAT AID WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, PAID FOR OUT OF THE MASSIVE TARIFF MONEY COMING INTO THE USA!"
"Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!"
Four great candidates are under consideration at DNI. Decision within next few weeks!
".The reason for this is that the Do Nothing Democrats, using disinformation Hoax number 7, don't want Bernie Sanders to get the Democrat Nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. It's all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!"
"Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which, because of the Economy, Jobs, the Military Vets, I will win in November), be careful of Russia, Russia, Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!"
"Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden the rest look weak, no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, don't let them take it away from you!"
Departing for India with Melania!
"Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) corrupt politician Adam 'Shifty' Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media. Someday he will be caught, that will be a very unpleasant experience!"
"Are any Democrat operatives, the DNC, or Crooked Hillary Clinton, blaming Russia, Russia, Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada. If so I suggest calling Bob Mueller the 13 Angry Democrats to do a new Mueller Report, Democrat Edition. Bob will get to the bottom of it!"

"Great new book just out, 'Taken for Granted, How Conservatives Can Win Back Americans That Liberalism Failed', by Gianni Caldwell, a young winner! He will be at the Ronald Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California, on Thursday at 6 PM, PT. Check it out!"
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn't like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!"
"CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, 'too soon', but turned out to be the correct decision. No matter how well we do, however, the.."
".Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let's keep it that way!"
52% in the new Rasmussen Poll. 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"I will be having a News Conference at the White House, on this subject, today at 600 P.M. CDC representatives, and others, will be there. Thank you!"
"Crazy, chaotic Democrat Debate last night. Fake News said Biden did well, even though he said half of our population was shot to death. Would be OVER for most. Mini Mike was weak and unsteady, but helped greatly by his many commercials (which are not supposed to be allowed."
".during a debate). Pocahontas was mean, undisciplined, mostly aiming at Crazy Bernie and Mini Mike. They don't know how to handle her, but I know she is a 'chocker'. Steyer was a disaster who, along with Mini, are setting records in $'s per vote. Just give me an opponent!"
Big Rally in the Great State of South Carolina on Friday. See you there!
"Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation. Only a very small number in U.S., China numbers look to be going down. All countries working well together!"
"Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates, that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is, he was not true to himself, and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting time on the Immigration Hoax, anything else they could do to make the Republican Party look bad, while I was busy calling early BORDER FLIGHT closings, putting us way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus. Dems called it VERY wrong!"
"To the people of South Carolina, Tom Steyer is a joke, laughed at by everyone, a total incompetent. He made money in coal, now he 'hates' coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance, a loser for South Carolina, doesn't deserve your vote!"
"Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were, perhaps, the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed 'Stop Frisk' after swearing by it for years, and even recently. He horribly overused it, then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!"
"The Dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from Bernie. Back room politics, which Bernie is not very good at. His people will not let it happen again!"
Thank you to all of the incredible Law Enforcement Officers in South Carolina tonight. We love you!
South Carolina was GREAT. A BIG REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD!
THANK YOU SOUTH CAROLINA!
I will be having a 130 P.M. Press Conference at the White House to discuss the latest CoronaVirus developments. Thank you!
"Dana, you are the real deal!"
THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
"Sleepy Joe Biden's victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg's Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!"
"Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!"
Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!
"Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!"
"I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated laughed at mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg's consultants and socalled 'advisors'(how did that advice work out? Don't ask!), are on the 'gravy train' and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don't pay them anymore Mike, they led you down."
..a very dark and lonely path! Your reputation will never be the same!
"A Poll in today's New York Post says that 77% of 'U.S. adults have confidence in their government's ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.' 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job!"
"Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play NO NOMINATION, AGAIN!"
I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made!
I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn't have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm vigilant!
"Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE, a business legend, has died. There was no corporate leader like 'neutron' Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife family!"
"As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don't, putting us at a.."
".competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!"
"The only people in favor of Mini Mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants, who are getting richer and richer by the day!"
They are staging a coup against Bernie!
Departing for the Great State of North Carolina!
"This is an incredible time for our nation—we are in the midst of the Great American Comeback! Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. Military. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!"
"The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut. Great for the middle class, great for the USA!"
"WOW! Sleepy Joe doesn't know where he is, or what he's doing. Honestly, I don't think he even knows what office he's running for!"
"Australia's Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China's Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us."
".paying higher rates than many others, when we should be paying less. Tough on our exporters and puts the USA at a competitive disadvantage. Must be the other way around. Should ease and cut rate big. Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve has called it wrong from day one. Sad!"
"Texas Oklahoma Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines. Petroleum based 'anything' is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don't vote for Mini Mike!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances. Also, as mayor he was very bad under pressure a choker!"
"The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!"
"The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His 'political' consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!"
"Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren, other than Mini Mike, was the loser of the night. She didn't even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!"
"The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!"
"So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn't!"
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!"
"Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn't in the race, Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won't go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg just 'quit' the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn't have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe's campaign, hoping to save face. It won't work!"
"Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O'Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his lifeand now on to Sleepy Joe!"
"Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can't buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!"
"There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!"
Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!
"As per recent Federal Court ruling, the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities. They should change their status and go nonSanctuary. Do not protect criminals!"
"I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible successful effort being made!"
Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!
"Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike's head, just dropped out of the Democrat PrimaryTHREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass."
"With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!"
"The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country. This is just more Fake News. We are investing greatly in our schools, and always will!"
"Thank you Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was a great evening!"
"Thank you David, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania. We will continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!"
"We have appointed 220 Federal Judges and two Supreme Court Justices. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!"
"The WALL is well under construction. So far we're up to 129 miles, and by early next year we will have 500 miles completed!"
Thank you Audrey!
"I will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order, and he won't even know he's doing it!"
"I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one."
.I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you!
"..least 5 States the Nomination. Did the DNC Dems tell Elizabeth Warren to wait? If so, they were deadly, the race would have been over, Bernie would have won. Dirty double dealing? Nobody knows for sure, history will be the judge. But I say, here we go AGAIN, Bernie!"
"We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!"
"The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism. They were a dead paper before I went into politics, and they will be a dead paper after I leave, which will be in 5 years. Fake News is the Enemy of the people!"
"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semiconsiderable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American."
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer said, 'You will pay the price for this. You won't know what HIT YOU.' That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.' Trouble ahead!"
Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?
"Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia, Russia, Russia. They are driving him Crazy!"
The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!
The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!
So much FAKE NEWS!
"Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!"
"Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!"
"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"
Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!
"Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage, with even bigger currency help. Also, stimulate!"
"The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!"
"Nancy Pelosi just said, 'I don't know if we can be ready this week.' In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!"
Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!
"Ronald Reagan's great economist, the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut!"
"If you like automobiles, how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also, no more than one car per family. I, on the other hand, have new plants being built all over Michigan, Plus!"
"Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER, almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican, unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!"
".(which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!"
"Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders. If she would have quit 3 days earlier, Sanders would have beaten Biden in a route, it wouldn't even have been close. They also got two other losers to support Sleepy Joe!"
"Vanity Fair Magazine, which will soon be out of business, and their third rate Fake reporters, who make up sources which don't exist, wrote yet another phony boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite. Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus!"
Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn't care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!
"America is the Greatest Country in the world. We have the best scientists, doctors, nurses and health care professionals. They are amazing people who do phenomenal things every day."
".Together we are putting into policy a plan to prevent, detect, treat and create a vaccine against CoronaVirus to save lives in America and the world. America will get it done!"
".We have the greatest healthcare system, experts, scientists and doctors anywhere in the world. Together, we will PREVAIL!"
I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!
I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 900 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office.
"The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life safety of the United States!"
"Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats, and please remember, very important for all countries businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods."
"Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted 'coup' of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!"
"KEEPING THE HOME SAFE, ENCOURAGE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS TO."
"KEEPING THE SCHOOL SAFE, ENCOURAGE YOUR FACULTY, STAFF, AND STUDENTS TO."

"KEEPING THE WORKPLACE SAFE, ENCOURAGE YOUR EMPLOYEES TO."
"108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping!"
"Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!"
"Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!"
". Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!"
"If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!"
"The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!"
"To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!"
"I will be having a news conference today at 300 P.M., The White House. Topic CoronaVirus!"
"To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a National Emergency."
We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need. No resource will be spared!
"At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry it will be kept that way!"
"It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer. We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these."
".No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!"
"Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earthWe will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need, and that they are entitled to. No resource will be spared."
"I fully support H.R. 6201 Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers. I have directed."
.the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put.
".the health and wellbeing of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!"
"To those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people."
Good teamwork between Republicans Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!
BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!
"Attending meetings on Covid19 in the White House. Working with States and local governments, many of whom have done a great job. Full report latter!"
SOCIAL DISTANCING!
News Conference at White House in 10 minutes.
THE UNITED STATES LOVES ITALY!
TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!
"We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!"
".The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!"
"Can't believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!"
"So now it is reported that, after destroying his life the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has 'lost' the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!"
"I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That's what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!"
God Bless the USA!
Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
Just had a very good teleconference with Nation's Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to 'do more'.
"Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!"
I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!
"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!"
"Cuomo wants 'all states to be treated the same.' But all states aren't the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big 'hotspot', West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it."
Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
"For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!"
I will totally protect your Medicare Social Security!
I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!
"I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the 'borders' from China against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful false!"
"The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG"
"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall. Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake Corrupt News, day and night. 'Russia, Russia, Russia', then 'the Ukraine Scam (where's the Whistleblower?)', the 'Impeachment Hoax', and more, more, more."
".Also, according to the Daily Caller, leading Sleepy Joe Biden in Florida, 48% to 42%."
"We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to nonessential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!"
15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD!
"I want all Americans to understand we are at war with an invisible enemy, but that enemy is no match for the spirit and resolve of the American people"
"It cannot overcome the dedication of our doctors, nurses, and scientists — and it cannot beat the LOVE, PATRIOTISM, and DETERMINATION of our citizens. Strong and United, WE WILL PREVAIL!"
"Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help, America will WIN."
"I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"
"STRONG UNITED, WE WILL PREVAIL!"
"We are going to WIN, sooner rather than later!"
SOCIAL DISTANCING!
"THANK YOU to our Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this!"
"HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. The FDA has moved mountains Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents).."
CHINESE VIRUS FACT CHECK
"WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"
"We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue, as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan. He will make the proper decision!"
"STRONG UNITED, WE WILL PREVAIL! GOD BLESS THE USA!!"
THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!
"The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got 'worse worse', until the headline alone made it very unfair. Fake Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!"
"It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus."
".is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!"
".us since the beginning of this crisis.' They meant the opposite? Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. Sleepy Joe said I was 'xenophobic', but I saved thousands of lives! Fake News!"
Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn't agree!
The Hill/HarrisX 61% to 39% Approval Rating on handling of Coronavirus situation. Thank you!
"The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States."
This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!
"Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!"
"Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!"
"Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!"
"I am working very hard to help New York City State. Dealing with both Mayor Governor and producing tremendously for them, including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won't help them because I don't like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!"
"Just reported that the United States has done far more 'testing' than any other nation, by far! In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!"
"The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well, ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo!"
"Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and the IOC, on their very wise decision to present the Olympics in 2021. It will be a great success, and I look forward to being there!"
The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!
"I hear that Fake News CNN just reported that I am isolated in the White House, wondering out loud, 'when will life return to normal?' Does anybody really believe that? There was no leak, they made it up they are CORRUPT FAKE NEWS."
".I have been packed all day with meetings, I have no time for stupidity. We're working around the clock to KEEP AMERICA SAFE!"
960 in the United States Senate. Congratulations AMERICA!
Will be going out in 10 minutes for the press conference.
Our great Oil Gas industry is under under seige after having one of the best years in recorded history. It will get better than ever as soon as our Country starts up again. Vital that it does for our National Security!
The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!
"costly. Workers small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn't their fault. It is 'HELL' dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the 'big picture' done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!"
"As usual with 'this' General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, 'very quickly'. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke 'P'."
Invoke 'P' means Defense Production Act!
We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today!
"Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THAT'S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. They 'maximum' delay even the best candidates, including Judges, leaving little time!"
Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!
"So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous corrupt people, who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!"
"One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent far reaching is the fact that corrupt 'journalists' base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see, 'five sources say', don't believe the story, it is."
".very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past!"
"I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing 'hot spots', New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly."
"With the courage of our doctors and nurses, with the skill of our scientists and innovators, with the determination of the American People, and with the grace of God, WE WILL WIN THIS WAR. When we achieve this victory, we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before!"
.Federal Government. A quarantine will not be necessary. Full details will be released by CDC tonight. Thank you!
Will be doing a press conference today at 500 P.M. The White House. People are working harder than I have ever seen people work. It is a beautiful thing to watch!
The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!
Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn't figured that out yet!
"alone attracted 6.2 million viewers for the president's briefing — an astounding number for a 6 p.m. cable broadcast, more akin to the viewership for a popular primetime sitcom"
"I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!"
Will be starting The White House news conference at 530 P.M. Eastern.
"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week, trying to add real 'junk' into the Bill. Got some bad things, having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus, included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020!"
White House news conference at 500 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"I watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country. Actually, other than her usual complaining that I'm a terrible person, she wasn't bad. Still praying!"
"With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4"
"Great news! American families will now be able to buy safer, more affordable, and environmentally friendly cars with our new SAFE VEHICLES RULE. Get rid of those old, unsafe clunkers. Build better and safer American cars and create American jobs. Buy American!"
My Administration is helping U.S. auto workers by replacing the failed Obama Emissions Rule. Impossible to satisfy its Green New Deal Standard Lots of unnecessary and expensive penalties to car buyers!
"My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3500, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Positive impact on the environment! Foolish executives!"
Will be starting The White House news conference at 515 P.M. Eastern.
"Congress must pass the old, and very strongly proven, deductibility by businesses on restaurants and entertainment. This will bring restaurants, and everything related, back and stronger than ever. Move quickly, they will all be saved!"
"Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!"
"Somebody please explain to Cryin' Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral, in fact. New York has gotten far more than any other State, including hospitals a hospital ship, but no matter what, always complaining.."
"It wouldn't matter if you got ten times what was needed, it would never be good enough. Unlike other states, New York unfortunately got off to a late start. You should have pushed harder. Stop complaining find out where all of these supplies are going. Cuomo working hard!"
"Massive amounts of medical supplies, even hospitals and medical centers, are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government. Some have insatiable appetites are never satisfied (politics?). Remember, we are a backup for them. The complainers should"
".have been stocked up and ready long before this crisis hit. Other states are thrilled with the job we have done. Sending many Ventilators today, with thousands being built. 51 large cargo planes coming in with medical supplies. Prefer sending directly to hospitals."
"Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, I expect hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil gas industry!"
..Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels. Good (GREAT) news for everyone!
30 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD
We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. 'P Act' all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing will have a big price to pay!
I will be holding a News Conference at 330 P.M. at the White House. Thank you!
"The Paycheck Protection Program is up and running! The program is open to nonprofits as well, so banks be sure to sign up our Great Religious and Veteran Organizations that need help!"
"We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy. It is tough and smart, but we are tougher and smarter!"
White House news conference at 645 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"For humanitarian reasons, the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and, when appropriate, allowed to disembark, under strict supervision. Very carefully done. People we're dying no other countries would allow them to dock!"
USA STRONG!
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!
"Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can't say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!"
"Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a 'Virtual' Convention, one where he doesn't have to show up. Gee, I wonder why? Also, what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?"
White House news conference at 545 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"
"Why didn't the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!"
"Wisconsin, get out and vote NOW for Justice Daniel Kelly. Protect your 2nd Amendment!"
White House news conference at 530 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"The Radical Left Democrats have gone absolutely crazy that I am doing daily Presidential News Conferences. They actually want me to STOP! They used to complain that I am not doing enough of them, now they complain that I 'shouldn't be allowed to do them.' They tried to shame.."
"Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM, perhaps like never before!!!"
FLATTENING OF THE CURVE!
"Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!"
"Wow, Bernie is unwilling to give up his delegates, and wants more of them! What's that all about?"
Can't see AOC plus 3 supporting Sleepy Joe!
White House news conference at 530 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"Wishing a HAPPY PASSOVER to those celebrating in the United States, Israel, and around the world!"
"Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can't get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% MailIn Voting, which is 'RIPE for FRAUD,' and shouldn't be allowed!"
Great News Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care. Get well Boris!!!
".We will always be there for our Great Farmers, Cattlemen, Ranchers, and Producers!"
"This week, in only 4 days, we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!"
"Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason, with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts more. Big Economic Bounceback!"
"Congress must go back to DEDUCTIBILITY by businesses if Restaurants, Clubs Entertaiment is expected to flourish (like never before)!"
"Wow, Approval Rating in the Republican Party 96%. Thank you!"
HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY TO ALL!
"The White House Press Conference will take place today at 100 P.M., recognizing that it is Good Friday!"
"Because the T.V. Ratings for the White House News Conference's are the highest, the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media), the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats , of course, the few remaining RINO'S, are doing everything in their power to disparage end them. The People's Voice!"
The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!
"Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday, Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowoutNOT EVEN CLOSE! I haven't heard one member of the Fake News Establishment even mention this irrefutable fact. FAKE NEWS!"
"I think the situation is unprecedented, and there is no question about that. It's whiplash! The economy was moving forward at a rapid pace in terms of growth, jobs and even wage increases, and all of a sudden the pandemic hit and the."
.Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.
WE WILL BUILD IT AGAIN!
"The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn't going to be as high as reported, they (the opposition) act like they're sad because it's lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful.' West Virginia Resident, C Span"
"The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn't have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards, we'd have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!"
Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!
HAPPY EASTER!
"A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!"
HAPPY EASTER!
"Great businessman philanthropist Bernie Marcus, CoFounder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!dcexaminer"
"For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!"
The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!
"Governors, get your states testing programs apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks!"
"I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?"
"Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.."
".disaster, the Energy Industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia."
"For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect."
".It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!"
White House news conference today at 500 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"First the Fake News Media said that it's not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences, but it is the only way I can reach the American People, as seen in the below poll."
"My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late, great, Stanley Chera, one of Manhattan's most brilliant real estate minds. Stanley was charitable, kind, and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!"
The Democrats don't want to approve more money for our great workers under the incredibly successful 'Paycheck' plan. Replenish Account Now!
"Cuomo's been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state's responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won't happen!"
"GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD. THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!"
"Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty' was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!"
White House news conference today at 545 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
White House news conference today at 530 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
Democrats are blocking additional funding for the popular Paycheck Protection Program. They are killing American small businesses. Stop playing politics Dems! Support Refilling PPP NOW it is out of funds!
"Major News Conference tonight, the White House at 600 P.M. (Eastern), to explain Guidelines for OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN!"
"Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She's an incompetent, thirdrate politician!"
THANK GOD FOR TRUCKERS!
Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.
"Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!"
LIBERATE MINNESOTA!
LIBERATE MICHIGAN!
"LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!"
"Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining'. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with."
".testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help and equipment than any other state, by far, these great men women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action!"
"Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also, don't forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!"
"China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!"
The States have to step up their TESTING!
"Cuomo ridiculously wanted '40 thousand Ventilators'. We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!"
White House news conference today at 600 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 500 P.M. Thank you!
"No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different, but it's not. In fact, it's even worse"
".Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including 'it's over', could have made."
".them happy, or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!"
"The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is 'sources say', or 'officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity', or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn't even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!"
"Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the 'King of Ventilators', other countries are calling asking for helpwe will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!"
White House News Conference at 545. Thank you!
"Congratulations to all of my many friends at The Villages in Florida on having done so well, and with such great spirit, during these rather unusual times. So proud of everyone! Mark Morse Gary Lester have really stepped up to the plate. Hope to see everyone soon."
"Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, 'Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.' They screamed it loud clear, thought they had us cold, even though it was the State's task. But everyone got their V's, with many to spare. Now they scream."
"Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game. States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!"
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 530 P.M. Thank you!
"In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!"
"Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as 'nuts' as people are saying. He's worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. Wasn't worth the effort, his mind is shot!"
"It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I'm really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don't have nearly the power as once thought!"
"96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! This must also mean that, most importantly, we are doing a good (great) job in the handling of the Pandemic."
We will never let the great U.S. Oil Gas Industry down. I have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!
"I urge the Senate and House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for PPP, Hospitals, and Testing. After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief."
".to State/Local Governments for lost revenues from COVID 19, much needed Infrastructure Investments for Bridges, Tunnels, Broadband, Tax Incentives for Restaurants, Entertainment, Sports, and Payroll Tax Cuts to increase Economic Growth."
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 530 P.M. Thank you!
"Great new book just out by the Former Director of Ice, Tom Homan 'Defend the Border and Save Lives Solving Our Most Important Humanitarian and Security Crisis.' Great guy, get your copy today!"
"I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today. In the meantime, even without this order, our Southern Border, aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall 27,000 Mexican soldiers, is very tight including for human trafficking!"
"Happy Birthday to the great Cindy Adams of the New York Post. Cindy is 90, but looks 39 to me. She is going strong!"

.My cochair in Utah and a really great guy. Sean has my Complete and Total Endorsement!
"Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!"
Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
"Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!"
"Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!"
Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing.
"Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!"
"I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modernday technology. The people that work there are great, and we're going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!"
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 530 P.M. Thank you!
"Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!"
"It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!"
"We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a 'Hoax', I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with 'one person from China', and then grew, will be a 'Miracle' end!"
"If the Wall Street Journal 'Editorial' writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that I was 'NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.' You said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do!"
"Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt sick!"
"What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time effort!"
"Remember, the Cure can't be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense!"
"I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!"
"Happy Birthday to Melania, our great First Lady!"
"The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history. I don't know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!"
".schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night read see that I am angrily eating a hamburger Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!"
"Does anybody get the meaning of what a socalled Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, 'having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.' Does sarcasm ever work?"
"Blame the Democrats for any 'lateness' in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers."
"There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!"
"FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
"Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?"
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 530 P.M. Thank you!
"We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!"
Many States moving to SAFELY QUICKLY reopen!
"The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!"
"Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He's a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!"
Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC!
"Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!"
"What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!"
"FAKE POLLING, just like 2016 (but worse)!"
DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY GOT CAUGHT!
"We can't let the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?"
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over over again. 'We don't have enough testing ,' he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!"
"Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo most others can't stand him. AOC!"
"The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal."
".And then came a Plague, a great and powerful Plague, and the World was never to be the same again! But America rose from this death and destruction, always remembering its many lost souls, and the lost souls all over the World, and became greater than ever before!"
Thank you very much to our beautiful 'boaters.' I will never let you down!
"Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very nonthreatening, or matter of fact, manner"
".Fake News got it wrong again, as always, and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we're allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens, and as such, I welcome them with open arms!"
I'm with the TRUCKERS all the way. Thanks for the meeting at the White House with my representatives from the Administration. It is all going to work out well!
"Getting great reviews, finally, for how well we are handling the pandemic, especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators, the building of field hospitals beds, and soon, the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together!"
"Republicans love the biggest Tax Cuts, Rebuilt Military, Choice for Vets, saving 2nd Amendment and many other things my Administration has done, but what they love beyond all else is 252 (so far!) Federal Judges, not including two great Supreme Court Justices. A Big Record!"
"Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems, and now California, get this, doesn't want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President. Border is very tight and the Wall is rapidly being built!"
"Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not 'essential'. In any event, we have great testing capacity, and have performed 6.5 million tests, which is more than every country in the world, combined!"
MSDNC and FAKE NEWS CNN are going wild trying to protect China!
"A group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago, then again 8 years ago, and then got BADLY beaten by me, a political first timer, 4 years ago, have copied (no imagination) the concept of an ad from Ronald Reagan, 'Morning in America', doing everything possible to."
".get even for all of their many failures. You see, these loser types don't care about 252 new Federal Judges, 2 great Supreme Court Justices, a rebuilt military, a protected 2nd Amendment, biggest EVER Tax Regulation cuts, and much more. I didn't use any of them."
".because they don't know how to win, and their socalled Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe. I don't know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad. John Weaver lost big for Kasich (to me). Crazed Rick Wilson."
".lost for Evan 'McMuffin' McMullin (to me). Steve Schmidt Reed Galvin lost for John McCain, Romney's campaign manager (?) lost big to 'O', Jennifer Horn got thrown out of the New Hampshire Republican Party. They're all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican, is all smiles!"
Oil prices moving up nicely as demand begins again!
Heading to Arizona!
"Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts, which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped, which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also, saved big dollars!"
"For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners, here is the newest chart on our great testing 'miracle' compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA, instead of always ripping us down!"
"The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!"
"Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification business deductions for restaurants ent."
Getting ready to land in the Great State of Arizona!
"The White House CoronaVirus Task Force, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, has done a fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources that have set a high standard for others to follow in the future. Ventilators, which were few in bad shape, are now being."
".produced in the thousands, and we have many to spare. We are helping other countries which are desperate for them. Likewise, after having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests. Face masks shields,."
".gloves, gowns etc. are now plentiful. The last four Governors teleconference calls have been conclusively strong. Because of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. We may add or subtract people ."
".to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines Therapeutics. Thank you!"
The Fake News has reached an all time high!
"Congratulations to former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, and all others involved, on a complete and total exoneration (with a 90 vote by the U.S. Supreme Court) on the Obama DOJ Scam referred to as 'Bridgegate.' The Democrats."
"Yesterday was a BIG day for Justice in the USA. Congratulations to General Flynn, and many others. I do believe there is MUCH more to come! Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians do not go well together!"
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
"Retired Ice Director Tom Homan knows more about the Border and Border Security than anyone. He's a tough guy, but a good guy and as smart as they come. His new book, 'Defend The Border and Save Lives Solving Our Most Important Humanitarian and Security Crisis' is a."
.must read for anybody looking for U.S. Security and Protection. Go get it now and make Tom a Top Best Seller — he deserves it!
"So in California, the Democrats, who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots, and succeeded, have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It's all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!"
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
"Why is it that all of the political pundits consultants that I beat so easily badly, people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth, have become so totally 'unhinged' when it come to your favorite President, me. These people are stone cold crazy!"
"When are the Fake Journalists, who received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Scam, going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I'll give you the names, there are plenty of them!"
"We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls didn't have a clue!"
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!
OBAMAGATE!
"Great credit being given for our Coronavirus response, except in the Fake News. They are a disgrace to America!"
"Dems are trying to steal the Mike Garcia Congressional Race in California. Republicans, get out and VOTE for your terrific candidate, ASAP!"
"Coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better, going down almost everywhere. Big progress being made!"
OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!
"The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don't play politics. Be safe, move quickly!"
OBAMAGATE!
When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn't it obvious? What's happening now? A total nut job!
"Remember, get out and Vote for Mike Garcia in CA25. A really big deal for our Country!"
"Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don't blame them!"
"96% APPROVAL RATING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THANK YOU! We will win against a tired, exhausted man, Sleepy Joe Biden, in November."
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS
The American People are WARRIORS!
"Our Testing is the BEST in the World, by FAR! Numbers are coming down in most parts of our Country, which wants to open and get going again. It is happening, safely!"
"So interesting to see all of these people I beat so badly, pundits consultants that never had a chance, telling me how to run for office. Many are Republicans who should LOVE our 280 new Judges, rebuilt Military, 2A, great V.A. Low Taxes, etc. Just don't like that I beat them!"
"Remember this, every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus, and I am happy for them all, could in no way have gotten those numbers, or had that success, without me and the Federal Governments help. From Ventilators to Testing, we made it happen!"
"Looking forward to being in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. I love the State, and for very good reason!"
"Wisconsin, please get out NOW and vote for Tom Tiffany for Congress. A great guy!"
"Crude Oil prices going up as Saudi Arabia cuts production levels. Our great Energy Companies, with millions of JOBS, are starting to look very good again. At the same time, gasoline prices at record lows (like a big Tax Cut). The BEST of all Worlds. 'Transition To Greatness"
"As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the 'GIFT'. Big numbers!"
"Big News Tom Tiffany of the Great State of Wisconsin has just become Congressman Tom Tiffany. He will do a FANTASTIC job for the people of Wisconsin, and the United States. Congratulations!"
"Big Congressional win in California for Mike Garcia, taking back a seat from the Democrats. This is the first time in many years that a California Dem seat has flipped back to a Republican. Also, Tom Tiffany beat his Democrat rival BIG in Wisconsin. Two great Congressional WINS!"
"When the socalled 'rich guys' speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?"
"As I have said for a long time, dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do. We just made a great Trade Deal, the ink was barely dry, and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn't make up the difference and all those innocent lives lost!"
OBAMAGATE!
"The Great State of Wisconsin, home to Tom Tiffany's big Congressional Victory on Tuesday, was just given another win. Its Democrat Governor was forced by the courts to let the State Open. The people want to get on with their lives. The place is bustling!"
"I don't know the socalled Whistleblower Rick Bright, never met him or even heard of him, but to me he is a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government!"
22O in my endorsements of Congressional Candidates this season. California Wisconsin won big on Tuesday. Thank you to all of those very brilliant Voters. You will not be disappointed!
"Good numbers coming out of States that are opening. America is getting its life back! Vaccine work is looking VERY promising, before end of year. Likewise, other solutions!"
On my way to PENNSYLVANIA!
"Thank you to all of my great Keyboard Warriors. You are better, and far more brilliant, than anyone on Madison Avenue (Ad Agencies). There is nobody like you!"
OBAMAGATE!
"Why is it that China, for decades, and with a population much bigger than ours, is paying a tiny fraction of $'s to The World Health Organization, The United Nations and, worst of all, The World Trade Organization, where they are considered a socalled 'developing country' and"
"..are therefore given massive advantages over The United States, and everyone else? Prior to the Plague floating in from China, our Economy was blowing everybody away, the best of any country, EVER. We will be there again, and soon!"
"Phyllis George was a great person and a true pioneer for women in television. The NFL could not have made a better 'pick' when they choose Phyllis to be the first woman to represent them. Also, a wonderful First Lady of Kentucky as the wife of Gov. John Y. Brown."
.May Phyllis Rest In Peace. Warmest condolences to her beloved family!!!
"Doing REALLY well, medically, on solving the CoronaVirus situation (Plague!). It will happen!"
"The Obama Administration is turning out to be one of the most corrupt and incompetent in U.S. history. Remember, he and Sleepy Joe are the reasons I am in the White House!!!"
"The number of Coronavirus cases is strongly trending downward throughout the United States, with few exceptions. Very good news, indeed!"
REOPEN OUR COUNTRY!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS
"The Wall Street Journal Editorial states that it doesn't want me to act in an 'impulsive' manner in Afghanistan. Could somebody please explain to them that we have been there for 19 years, and while soldier counts are way down now, hardly impulsive. Besides, the Taliban is.."
"..mixed about even wanting us to get out. They make a fortune $$$ by having us stay, and except at the beginning, we never really fought to win. We are more of a police force than the mighty military that we are, especially now as rebuilt. No, I am not acting impulsively!"
LOSER!
OIL (ENERGY) IS BACK!!!!
Today we commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Saint John Paul II. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is selfexplanatory!
"Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the 'incompetence of China', and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!"
"Now that our Country is 'Transitioning back to Greatness', I am considering rescheduling the G7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David. The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all normalization!"
"My team is closely monitoring the flooding in Central Michigan Stay SAFE and listen to local officials. Our brave First Responders are once again stepping up to serve their fellow citizens, THANK YOU!"
"Congratulations to my daughter, Tiffany, on graduating from Georgetown Law. Great student, great school. Just what I need is a lawyer in the family. Proud of you Tiff!"
Michigan sends absentee ballot applications to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!
"Great call with thousands of our Hispanic community, business, and faith leaders today. During this national trial, we have been uplifted by the grit, determination, prayers, and patriotism of Hispanic Americans."
".Together, we built the greatest economy in history. We will do it again better than ever before!"
"Spokesman speaks stupidly on behalf of China, trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace."
".It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn't!"
"China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to ripoff the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!"
".Hahn, Richard Goodstein, Donna Brazile, Niel Cavuto, and many others. They repeat the worst of the Democrat speaking points, and lies. All of the good is totally nullified, and more. Net Result BAD! CNN MSDNC are all in for the Do Nothing Democrats! Fox WAS Great!"
I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to halfstaff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus.
".On Monday, the flags will be at halfstaff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation."
96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"Is this even possible to believe? Can this be for real? Where is this nursing home, how is the victim doing?"
"The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault, I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!"
"Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have until I came along and brought business back to Michigan. JOBS!"
HARRIS IS A GREAT AMERICAN!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
"The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and 'force' people to sign. Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam!"
"Cases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!"
"Sleepy Joe's representatives have just put out an ad saying that I went to play golf (exercise) today. They think I should stay in the White House at all times. What they didn't say is that it's the first time I've played golf in almost 3 months, that Biden was constantly.."
"vacationing, relaxing making shady deals with other countries, that Barack was always playing golf, doing much of his traveling in a fume spewing 747 to play golf in Hawaii Once even teeing off immediately after announcing the gruesome death of a great young man by ISIS!"
OBAMAGATE!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"full attendance in the Arena. In other words, we would be spending millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space. Plans are being."
"made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August. They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced"
"to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site. This is not something I want to do. Thank you, and I LOVE the people of North Carolina!"
HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY!
"TRANSITION TO GREATNESS! Get ready, it is already happening again!"
"Some stories about the fact that in order to get outside and perhaps, even a little exercise, I played golf over the weekend. The Fake Totally Corrupt News makes it sound like a mortal sin I knew this would happen! What they don't say is that it was my first golf in almost"
".3 months and, if I waited 3 years, they would do their usual 'hit' pieces anyway. They are sick with hatred and dishonesty. They are truly deranged! They don't mention Sleepy Joe's poor work ethic, or all of the time Obama spent on the golf course, often flying to."
".Hawaii in a big, fully loaded 747, to play. What did that do to the socalled Carbon Footprint? He also played moments after the brutal killing by ISIS of a wonderful young man. Totally inappropriate and it was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. I was left a MESS!"
"Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned, in late January, people coming in from China. He called me 'xenophobic' then went equally 'nuts' when we let in 44,000 people until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized!"
"Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted, including ripoff Trade Deals. I am getting it all back!"
"Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people!"
Joe Biden's handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster. Even polls on the matter were terrible!
"There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that MailIn Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged even illegally printed out fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.."
".living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"
".about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I knew him well, far better than most. So many unanswered obvious questions, but I won't bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?"
"Stock Market up BIG, DOW crosses 25,000. SP 500 over 3000. States should open up ASAP. The Transition to Greatness has started, ahead of schedule. There will be ups and downs, but next year will be one of the best ever!"
"We made most Governors look very good, even great, by getting them the Ventilators, unlimited Testing, and supplies, all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles. So they look great, and I just keep rolling along, doing great things and getting Fake Lamestream News!"
"For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn't done my job well, early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That's 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early!"
".One person lost to this invisible virus is too much, it should have been stopped at its source, China, but I acted very quickly, and made the right decisions. Many of the current political complainers thought, at the time, that I was moving far to fast, like Crazy Nancy!"
.A total double standard. The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media!
"I hope all Republican House Members vote NO on FISA until such time as our Country is able to determine how and why the greatest political, criminal, and subversive scandal in USA history took place!"
".Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!"
"Great News The boring but very nasty magazine, The Atlantic, is rapidly failing, going down the tubes, and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20% of its staff in order to limp into the future. This is a tough time to be in the Fake News Business!"
"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that."
".happen again. Just like we can't let large scale MailIn Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!"
"We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!"
OBAMAGATE MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE SMALL POTATOES!
"We are acting as a police force, not the fighting force that we are, in Afghanistan. After 19 years, it is time for them to police their own Country. Bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before, if necessary!"
"We pass 15,000,000 Tests Today, by far the most in the World. Open Safely!"
"Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!"
Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!
WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS IS WRONG!
"If the FISA Bill is passed tonight on the House floor, I will quickly VETO it. Our Country has just suffered through the greatest political crime in its history. The massive abuse of FISA was a big part of it!"
"At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd."
.I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!
"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!"
USAttyHuber Whatever happen to John Huber?
This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!
"We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000. To all of the families friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy love for everything that these great people stood for represent. God be with you!"
"All over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad 'gift' from China, marches on. Not good!"
"Thank you to our GREAT Republican Congressmen Congresswomen on your incredibly important blockage last night of a FISA Bill that would just perpetuate the abuse that produced the Greatest Political Crime In the History of the U.S., the Russian WitchHunt. Fantastic Job!"
"The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through midAugust, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts."
MAILIN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION. BIG MAILIN VICTORY IN TEXAS COURT TODAY. CONGRATS!!!
"I can't stand back watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard get the job done right.."
"Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!"
CHINA!
The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!
REVOKE 230!
"Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means."
".It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!"
".got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard didn't know what hit them. The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would."
".have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. 'We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and."
These are 'Organized Groups' that have nothing to do with George Floyd. Sad!
"Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton. How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats? Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones). STRENGTH!"
It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don't lay the blame on others!
"Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME! Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests. Thank you!"
"80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE. They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses), homes, and the community of good, hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace, equality, and to provide for their families."
The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn't do. Should have been used 2 days ago there would not have been damage Police Headquarters would not have been taken over ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games!
"Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest. There is nobody better, but they must be allowed to do their job!"
"Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night. The ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!"
"Other Democrat run Cities and States should look at the total shutdown of Radical Left Anarchists in Minneapolis last night. The National Guard did a great job, and should be used in other States before it is too late!"
The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.
"The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS!"
Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!
LAW ORDER!
FAKE NEWS!
NOVEMBER 3RD.
"Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more. Joe doesn't know anything about it, he is clueless, but they will be the real power, not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all, Plus!"
"Anarchists, we see you!"
I will be delivering brief remarks from the Rose Garden at 630 P.M. Eastern to update on the Federal Response.
My fellow Americans My first and highest duty as President is to defend our great Country and the American People. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our Nation and that is exactly what I will do
"Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife Scum. The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo's ratings are down 50%!"
Vaccines are coming along really well. Likewise therapeutics. Moving faster than anticipated. Good news ahead (in many ways)!
"Republicans, get out and vote today for those great candidates that will lead to big victories on November 3rd. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don't make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!"
SILENT MAJORITY!
AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
"Macy's at 34th. Street, long the largest single department store anywhere in the world, a point of pride in NYC, was devastated yesterday when hoodlums and thieves vandalized it, breaking almost all of its large panels of storefront glass. What a shame. Bring in National Guard!"
"Sleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years, and did nothing. Now he pretends to have the answers. He doesn't even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs, and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW ORDER!"
"Washington, D.C., was the safest place on earth last night!"
"then tell them they will not be able to gain entry. Governor Cooper is still in ShelterInPlace Mode, and not allowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised. Would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World, and brought in hundreds of"
"Our highest respect to the family of David Dorn, a Great Police Captain from St. Louis, who was viciously shot and killed by despicable looters last night. We honor our police officers, perhaps more than ever before. Thank you!"
"So pathetic to watch the Fake News Lamestream Media playing down the gravity and depravity of the Radical Left, looters and thugs, ripping up our Liberal Democrat run (only) cities. It is almost like they are all working together?"
Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman!
LAW ORDER!
"In 3 1/2 years, I've done much more for our Black population than Joe Biden has done in 43 years. Actually, he set them back big time with his Crime Bill, which he doesn't even remember. I've done more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in U.S. history, with"
".the possible exception of another Republican President, the late, great, Abraham Lincolnand it's not even close. The Democrats know this, and so does the Fake News, but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt! See 'pinned' above."
"Probably the only thing Barack Obama I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, felt great about it. His nickname was 'Chaos', which I didn't like, changed to 'Mad Dog"
"His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom 'brought home the bacon'. I didn't like his 'leadership' style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!"
"I feel more and more confident that our economy is in the early stages of coming back very strong. Not everyone agrees with me, but I have little doubt. Watch for September, October, November. Next year will be one of the best ever, and look at the Stock Market NOW!"
LAW ORDER!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"I am to happy announce that Navy Veteran, Michael White, who has been detained by Iran for 683 days, is on a Swiss plane that just left Iranian Airspace. We expect him to be home with his family in America very soon."
.I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas! Thank you Switzerland for your great assistance.
"I just got off the phone with former American hostage Michael White, who is now in Zurich after being released from Iran. He will be on a U.S. plane shortly, and is COMING HOME"
"to the UNITED STATES! We have now brought more than 40 American hostages and detainees back home since I took office. Thank you to Iran, it shows a deal is possible!"
YOU DON'T BURN CHURCHES IN AMERICA!
"I thought this letter from respected retired Marine and Super Star lawyer, John Dowd, would be of interest to the American People. Read it!"
"The problem is not the very talented, lowflying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city, the problem is the arsonists, looters, criminals, and anarchists, wanting to destroy it (and our Country)!"
"John Kelly didn't know I was going to fire James Mattis, nor did he have any knowledge of my asking for a letter of resignation. Why would I tell him, he was not"
"in my innercircle, was totally exhausted by the job, and in the end just slinked away into obscurity. They all want to come back for a piece of the limelight!"
"The problem with asking for someone to give you a letter of resignation, which you do as a courtesy to help them save face, is that it is then harder to say you fired them. I did fire James Mattis. He was no good for Obama, who fired him also, and was no good for me!"
"Few people know where they'll be in two years from now, but I do, in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski. She voted against HealthCare, Justice Kavanaugh, and much else"
"Unrelated, I gave Alaska ANWR, major highways, and more. Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don't care, I'm endorsing. If you have a pulse, I'm with you!"
"Sleepy Joe Biden's 1994 Crime Bill was a total disaster. It was mass incarceration for Black people, many of them innocent. I did Criminal Justice Reform, something Obama Biden didn't even try to do  couldn't do even if they did try. Biden can never escape his Crime Bill!"
I will be doing a News Conference at 1000 A.M. on the Jobs Numbers! White House.
"Congratulations to wonderful Charles Payne on having been so optimistic, and therefore correct. Market up BIG!!!"
"Oh no, the Dems are worried again. The only one that can kill this comeback is Sleepy Joe Biden!"
"over the last number of nights. If she doesn't treat these men and women well, then we'll bring in a different group of men and women!"
"I am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he's truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high"
"We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag NO KNEELING!"
Wow! 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party (and I believe this was before the 'GREAT' Jobs Numbers yesterday). Thank you!
LAW ORDER!
"Much smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated. National Guard, Secret Service, and D.C. Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!"
Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to 'DEFUND THE POLICE'. I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW ORDER!
"I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control. They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!"
"Not only will Sleepy Joe Biden DEFUND THE POLICE, but he will DEFUND OUR MILITARY! He has no choice, the Dems are controlled by the Radical Left."
"Colin Powell, a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars, just announced he will be voting for another stiff, Sleepy Joe Biden. Didn't Powell say that Iraq had 'weapons of mass destruction?' They didn't, but off we went to WAR!"
"Somebody please tell highly overrated Colin Powell that I will have gotten almost 300 Federal Judges approved (a record), Two Great Supreme Court Justices, rebuilt our once depleted Military, Choice for Vets, Biggest Ever Tax Regulation Cuts, Saved Healthcare 2A, much more!"
"I built the greatest economy in the World, the best the U.S. has ever had. I am doing it again!"
"If I wasn't constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations, Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Hoax, I'd be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair, but it is what it is!!!"
"Colin Powell was a pathetic interview today on Fake News CNN. In his time, he was weak gave away everything to everybody so bad for the USA. Also got the 'weapons of mass destruction' totally wrong, and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad! Only negative questions asked."
"Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell's rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country our Flag?"
"LAW ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!"
"CNN Polls are as Fake as their Reporting. Same numbers, and worse, against Crooked Hillary. The Dems would destroy America!"
"The Lamestream Media refuses to talk about our Country's record setting Jobs Numbers, which are indicating GREATNESS, and soon!"
96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
"Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever!"
"This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country's recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW ORDER!"
"I have retained highly respected pollster, McLaughlin Associates, to analyze todays CNN Poll (and others), which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving. Read analysis for yourself. This is the same thing they and others did when we defeated"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016. They are called SUPPRESSION POLLS, and are put out to dampen enthusiasm. Despite 3 ? years of phony Witch Hunts, we are winning, and will close it out on November 3rd!"
NASDAQ HITS ALLTIME HIGH!

"It has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our Legendary Military Bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Benning in Georgia, etc. These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a"
"history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom. The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations"
Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!
LAW ORDER!
"Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle, run by Radical Left Democrats, of course. LAW ORDER!"
"Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. 'A walk in the park', one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, S.S. GREAT JOB!"
THOSE THAT DENY THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT!
"The Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine Therapeutics/Cure. That's my opinion. WATCH!"
Anarchists just took over Seattle and the Liberal Democrat Governor just said he knows 'nothing about that'.
"Seriously failed presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren, just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars. Hopefully our great Republican Senators won't fall for this!"
The Radical Left Democrats First they try to take away your guns. Then they try to take away your police!
"The Republican Party has not yet voted on a Platform. No rush. I prefer a new and updated Platform, short form, if possible."
"Seattle Mayor says, about the anarchists takeover of her city, 'it is a Summer of Love'. These Liberal Dems don't have a clue. The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it is just wonderful, even the death. Must end this Seattle takeover now!"
"rebuilding America's infrastructure with projects like the Portal North Bridge, which I have given authorization to proceed!"
"of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests"
"We have already had ticket requests in excess of 200,000 people. I look forward to seeing everyone in Oklahoma!"
LAW ORDER!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"On behalf of our entire nation, CONGRATULATIONS to the incredible West Point Class of 2020!"
"The ramp that I descended after my West Point Commencement speech was very long steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery. The last thing I was going to do is 'fall' for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum!"
Does anyone notice how little the Radical Left takeover of Seattle is being discussed in the Fake News Media. That is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness ineptitude play politically. The Mayor Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed!
"Interesting how ANTIFA and other Far Left militant groups can take over a city without barely a wimpier from soft Do Nothing Democrat leadership, yet these same weak leaders become RADICAL when it comes to shutting down a state or city and its hard working, tax paying citizens!"
THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!
Many Democrats want to Defund and Abolish Police Departments. HOW CRAZY!
"I've done more in less than 4 years than Biden's done in more than 40 years, including for Black America. Biden has been a part of every failed decision for decades. Bad Trade Deals, Endless Wars, you name it, he has shown a complete lack of leadership. He's weak shot!!!"
"Almost One Million people request tickets for the Saturday Night Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma!"
"The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won't work!"
"Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases. Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases. Testing is a double edged sword Makes us look bad, but good to have!!!"
LAW ORDER!
"We have greater confidence in our call for a Vshaped recovery, given recent upside surprises in growth data and policy action.' Chetan Ahya, Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley"
