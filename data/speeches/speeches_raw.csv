"But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better"
These are disasters
Their warriors
"Biden didn't agree, he didn't, they just told him what's happening"
I hear everyone didn't like me
"We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country"

So Biden's put forward a platform that would end America as we know it

I'm going to look forward to it
Great spirit

Bomb
I'll take it
And just hope they remember you every once in a while

They advocate only economic surrender
One wants open borders
Down nine

I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House
And nobody's done it like we've done it
"And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades"
It was like this

"It's now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before"
"Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument"
And the press will not write it
They want to talk
"He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen"
Is that okay? I don't want to have a problem with men
I'd be the meanest man in history
I've never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received
"So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here"
We really appreciate it
They've gone crazy
"I'm the one that says open it up, let's play football"
What they do on television is so disgusting
I never say this
"You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind"
And it's… Wait
Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community
Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review
150 million! That means 50% of our country
But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice
He watches every one of these rallies
"Remember President Obama? 28 times, remember 28 times, they counted them and there's much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor"
We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again
You have only one choice
"And again, Tucker's been very good I have to say"
"That's like one of many, many things"
"Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals? Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you're right back on the street the next day"
"No, no"
"And, I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right? But, we don't fight anymore"
So it's great that we're getting them new ships
It was a big thing
But we've all done the great job
"But maybe that could be Rick, because they still don't have any idea what he got"
Say no and walk
Why would we lose Michigan? Look at this
"You can't go to church, you can't do anything"
"He'll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country"
We've tested now 25 million people
Everything was negative
This is the guy I'm running against
"But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story"
Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot
We had the best numbers anybody's ever had
The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning
And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with
"Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country"
"They couldn't even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don't think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it"

"Right here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community"
"We're working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz"
"And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad's basement"
And they don't want criminals coming across
This is going to be big tonight
We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
"Are you having a good time, sir? I think you are"
That's what we have
And he was jobless
"That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy"
Canceled culture
She was like a dropping rock in water
"We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax"
Nobody's running against us in so many states
"And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll"
"Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes"
In this region … … thousand soldiers protecting our border
They're all going to come
We got to go Republican all the way
"We've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we don't win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it's like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on"
Now it's a disgrace what's happened
"If we wouldn't have closed it, we would've been talking two and a half or three million"
Only in Colorado could somebody say that
I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer
"Richard used to call me up five, six years ago"
Biden- No that was really great
"He never won a point, he lost everything"
"I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen"
"That's what it is called, favored nation clause"
"Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth"
I was very impressed
So the Biden's got rich while America got robbed
"You know what's happening, you know what's going on"
I guarantee you that
"In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down"
"We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day"
Good night everybody
Only way
"Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn't choke, they're fantastic"
I tell this story all the time
And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
That's never happened before
This room wasn't designed for this many people
"Remember when Barbara Streisand, she's another beauty, by the way"
And here's the big thing
We'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year
"That's a big area, even in an ocean, right? It's massive"
I'm so proud of that
They're meeting the President
"I haven't liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr"
"What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over"
"That's what we do, right? So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we can't deal with too much"
She wasn't too happy with me last year
But we can't let that happen
"And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers"
"Well, let's see what happens"
It's us
"I hear good things, Derrick"
They grabbed them
But they're very happy with their wall
"The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country"
I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July
They want to open
Nobody going to mess with them
"That's not nice, even for me"
"And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come"
"Was that the greatest evening? But I'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God"
But I've been rough on them
"And I got it done, but that's the way it is"
We lost so much
"Diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30, 40, 50 years"
And veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low
"By the way, I was endorsed by New York's finest and we're with them all the way"
And I got it approved about 11 months ago
But you know what? The people can hear the crowd
"We want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit"
We will never let it happen
This guy you're going to have Portland's all over this country
"I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning … It's like you're a track star"
"In Virginia, they want to take your guns away"
"I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years"
James is good
Forget it
I got a reel on him
"He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping"
The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe
"In three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio"
And Accountability
Right up until the moment of birth
This guy doesn't know he's alive
My plan is to arrest them
We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States
The good news is we're having the best times in history in our country
Right? Ain't that true? And she left the company
"So, thank you"
I'll see you later
And this was one of the richest nations in the world
They're paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They're stupid people
All of them helped
"I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected"
That was a wonderful day for me
"Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise"
And they're seeing a spike
We worked out deals with every one of them
"I'd like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that"
"And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing"
"We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built"
"Thank you, Lee"
"The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don't know who he is, he's probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth"
"Oh, I didn't know I was in Wisconsin"
"Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them"
It's wrong
See the beast
And I'll choose only from that list
"But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing"
"The Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy"
"We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it"
We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military
It's also why we need four more years
You can't do anything
"I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy"
"It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second"
Now we have brand new jets
Not nearly as bad as others
"See I put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour, thanks Brian"
So I came up with this incredible plan
He's 100 and he looks good
He did nothing and he got nominated
I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office
"We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st"
And they worked one job versus two or three jobs
"No, he signed an executive order shutting it down"
I never had that before
"We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America"
They call it loopholes
But we're draining that sucker slowly but surely
"I don't care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions"
It wasn't a pretty picture
Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy
Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed
"You know, I'm supposed to watch"
She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones
"We've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh"
They don't like the gas
"Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb"
"They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders"
All right? We're going to be doing it
"The Nittany Lions, they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots"
"Together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity"
"Yucca mountain, please"
And it's my honor
"Instead I work my ass off up here, okay? Yeah"
"Today, I like it a lot"
It was heading in the wrong direction
They even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures
"Under just three years of by administration, 3"
We have ended that program
"Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for"
It all left the state of Michigan
"Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal"
"Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier"
I want to see it
"Based on that, you know what? I never stopped you"
You see what's happening in California
"What a crowd, what a crowd"
You can't win Michigan
Just leave it the way it is
I really appreciate it
"And when you read about deportation and Sunday, we've got a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of people… and we're always shooting for the bad ones first"
I gave them everything
I don't talk about my ass
It just came out
You catch them
8 billion out their window
"But they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild"
You know what she's worth? Zero ratings
"President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia"
We put a brand new wall up
We got to straighten out our immigration laws
He said it
I like my foreign policy
That crazy Nancy
"Thank you, Martha"
"Thank you, James"
"And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement"
"That's Duffy, in case anybody … And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great"
And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world
You have records
"Trent Kelly, Michael Guest"
"He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children's future to China and other faraway lands"
They had some rough times since then
You can forget it
We're friends
Never happened before
A shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American
"Ben Carson, good man, he was down"
I hear we're doing well
He seems to be leading
"Now, I don't want to give them any ideas, because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy"
"After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman"
"Forget the country for a second, you have the best economy you've ever had, you have your best unemployment numbers, you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state, you have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers"
I'll be going to California tomorrow
"We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins"
That's the way they do it
"I mean, I get that too"
Communism's really bad
"Right there, and he's very far away from me"
"Korea, I renegotiated the deal"
"You've had presidents, they never put America first"
"Tremendous guy, really successful"
"Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues"
We'll be with the governor
I don't know what's going on
"We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment"
But they're not looking for that
They don't want to say it
"The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies"
"President Obama tried, he couldn't get it done"
"He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom"
"Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get… Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right? I was going to tell you before"
"If I would have said that, nobody would have believed it"
We take care of the bill
"You know what that is, they choked"
He wants to get rid of your second amendment
"I mean, we're going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday"
"Unlike Biden, I'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement"
"You don't have to wear masks, you don't have to do anything"
"Oh, good riddance"
"On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we're doing it"
I will let them have it like you've never heard before
Joe Biden's agenda is made in China
"We had to do it, we had to do it"
We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China
"President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created"
You got the perfect first lady
So they're not exactly happy
"Don't forget, last time I talked, I said we're going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you"
No blood
"We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands"
President
"Should I say it? Yeah, why not"
"She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said"
"And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he's going to get 50 Republican votes and he's going to get 50 Democrat votes"
That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way
You focus
Think of that
Right? Except these young ones
"Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA"
"5-million votes, and we won"
Wonderful
The largest amount
I can tell you right now
Greg Stanton
"Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody"
"And Henry, please stand, please"
It'll be faster
They want to kill our cows
"But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs"
They're going to be here to get out the vote
"It's a very, very outstanding senator"
Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs
It was crashing
Fred Ducette and Lou Gargiulo
Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
Make it electric
It's going up fast
"Then, they hid her body in a water drain"
"The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force"
"And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men's hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics"
"We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great … Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible"
You look at Russia
"00 to $25,000"
Everyone's swinging or they end up standing up
"We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again"
"Nobody knows that, but he's a fake"
"And then the number came out, 225,000"
"Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie"
"So, you're back"
And it was such a disgusting thing
"We're working with our veterans, we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans"
They didn't know what they were doing
Is it a possibility we'll use both? Maybe one a little bit less
We take it away
"You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners"
"So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right? It's all going because of me"
But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else
We're a very big party

"I'm probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand"

"I'm just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody"

They're not doing well
"Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we're smarter than them"
They got hit so hard
"This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party"
"And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing"
It is a terrible thing he's done
And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go
